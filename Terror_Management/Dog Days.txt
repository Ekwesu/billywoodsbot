Dog Days Lyrics
Arms akimbo, had me a by myself meetin'
Still speakin' in code
Trust about as far as\u2005I\u2005can throw
This ain't\u2005the world you used to know
You\u2005ain't notice cause it change slow
Gasoline rainbow, Serengeti cold Hell froze
Numb, watchin' the price on these elbows go through the floor
The metropolis hum and glow, the tent city grow
The punchline the whole joke
The whole thing a hoax
The empty boast bounce round the holdin' cell
Grandma broach on that pawn shop scale
Better than me, tried and failed (yup)
The sun runnin' hot, the tar boil
The children's eyes shine like bits of foil
Pig par-broiled, thick lard coat the glass
Hard R on my n-word, if you have to ask


The blackest laugh as the crackas crashed, that's schadenfreude
Whitey always gets his pass, though
That's unavoidable, like mercury in the fish
I wave goodbye to Portugal
The wave high, I'm a long fuckin' way from those portables
The blackest laugh is the crackas crashed, that's schadenfreude
Whitey always get his pass, though
That's unavoidable, like mercury in the fish
Wave goodbye to Portugal
The wave high, I'm a long way from seventh-grade portables
You might also like
400 Degreez and I can't see Louisiana
Water skiin', Sweet Home Alabama
Play you some Neil Young on the piano
It's a lotta room in my day planner
Watch a live show through the camera
Sent a dick pick and thanked her for the candor

(Is my phone ringing?)Embed
