Birdsong Lyrics
Came in Birdsong's dice game early, thinkin'
And grabbed the motherfuckin' hand like Kunstler v Dershowitz
Ejected\u2005from\u2005the vehicle
Spit a\u2005sixteen or two in mid-air, Satanic\u2005Verses
That'll rattle in your head like small caliber lead
Once she dead, rush her to the grave
Said \cut\, cut it to the lathe
Said \what?\, then  him in the face
Said it's a flood on the way, dried blood on the bullpen cage
Daddy loved his slaves, curl of the lip, heavy eyes just the same
First time you saw the word nigga in a book, how it danced on the page
Back in the day, it's what the family didn't say, how you knew it was AIDS
Came to the back gate late, I'ma need that back pay
Contra spread gun held by the waist
I didn't come by just to say hey (Don't flatter yourself)
Busta Rhymes on the A-train, countin' down the last days
Oh, and do you have any spare change?
Do you have any spare change?
Do you have any spare change?
Do you have any spare change?
Do you have any spare change?

He told 'em they could be God
He told 'em they could be God
He told 'em they could beat God
He told 'em they could beat God
HE told 'em they could beat God

Yeah but, but it, but the relationship
If you don't have a dream, fake it
But the relationship - you can't fake a dream
You got to fake it. Because we don't have dreams these days. How the hell can you have a dream, for what? So, so everybody's jiving. Well lets jive on that level
If I love you, I can't lie to you
Course you can lie to me; and you will. If you love me and you goin' off with Maddie someplace, you're lying to me. 'Cause what the hell do I care about the truth. I care if you're there, like Billie Holiday say \hush now, don't explain.\
Alright, I accept that. Alright, I accept that
Of course, of course you'll lie to me, 'cause I don't even wanna, of what, what does the truth matter? And why you gon' be truthful with me when you lie to everybody else. You lied when you smiled at that cracker down the job, right? Lie to me, smile. Treat me the same way you would treat him
I can't treat you the way I treat him
You must, you must, because I've caught the, I've caught the frowns and the anger. He's happy with you. Of course he doesn't know you're unhappy. You grin at him all day long. You come home and I catch hell, because I love you. I get least of you. I get, I get the very minimum. And I'm sayin', you know, fake it with me
