FNU LNU Lyrics
High beams errywhere I go
Erry beat, just put it in the yoke
Coach the West Coast,\u2005moving\u2005pocket
Flow work like\u2005vintage Ghost
Scared, 'cause errything came true\u2005that I wrote
Erry misfortune, the pen gloat
Erry blank page stretch like a moat
Erry road lead to an old verse, combin' my notes
Driveway weed-choked, sweet weed smoke
Lure police to gingerbread trap houses in deep snow
Warned 'em, but whitey always swear he know
So go 'head, my overhead like Heathrow
Sense of entitlement is Deebo
Spliff placebo, unroll a scroll deep in the stacks
Unfold bedroll by train tracks
Under bridge like a troll, California Cold
No need to see when you know in your bones
Hid ya hand, but I found 'em both, like Cicero in Rome


Home is where the hatred is
You hate it in the shelter (can't stand it)
Moms let you back in
Even though we said not to help ya
Home is where the hatred is
You hate it in the shelter (can't stand it)
Moms let you back in
Even though we said not to help ya
You might also like
(and now what)
Housing court fulla black women, black children
Fall down wells when CPS canvass the buildin'
I move like Art Modell with it
Liver spotted old lizard
They not even good, they just know where the game glitches
You gon' have to prove it's me in them pictures
Vaudevillian elixirs and tinctures, Road-To-The-Riches
Turned to Empire Boulevard, Courtyard-By-Mariott
Cooler fulla baboon hearts, sutures
Still fresh case it reject the human part
Or whatever part still human that recoil
Standin' room only at the viewing
Joe Kony still standin' in the ruins
When the 'puters stop 'putin'
The movement stop movin'
That's when the app said to stop shootin'


Home is where the basement is
Watch 'em all scurry for shelter
When that blast wave hit
It just might melt yaEmbed
