Myth Lyrics
Finger to the wind
The town tense
Had a sixth sense
Skip town before the town lynch
He had\u2005a\u2005gift
The Brown Grinch
Light\u2005on his feet
Peep a creeping Crown\u2005Vic
Misshapen head, but the crown fit
Crown Fried all thighs
The Crown Prince hogtied
He was a toad
Wasn't asking for no kiss
Mind my own, but got no respect for a pimp
Whitey stole the soul, came back 'round like we old friends
Guess he couldn't find the fence
Shotgun blow the brains out your old dog
The child flinch
Scramble for mask gas swirl in a trench
Feel like '14, my grandfather first breath
Side of a mountain
Basin full of blood
Hollerin' and shoutin', I'm from red mud
Where time stretch 'til you stop countin'
