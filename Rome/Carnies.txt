Carnies Lyrics


I knew tonight would be the end of my life, I knew tonight
I knew tonight would be the end, I'm new tonight, it's the end of my life, I knew tonight
I'm new tonight, it's the end of my life, I knew tonight
I knew tonight, I'm new tonight, I knew it was the end of my life
I cuffed the mic, trapped the sound pressure, bust pipes
Water-ship down, this all block, we just let you come around, now you making this hot
No good deed unpunished, popcorn in a bucket
Watch the stock plummet like I knew tonight would be the end of my life
I knew tonight would be the end of my life, I'm new tonight
I'm new tonight and it's the end of my life
I knew tonight, I knew tonight


There will be no more evictions, we're letting the projects rot
Purer needs you couldn't boil out the pot
As your body fails, scaling the roof, ladders and chute
Vertical patrolling the suit
Jump, jump man, is it the shoes, swoosh
I hate the suits and waking life
When I die, keep the top button fastened
I'm hard bottom shining, I'mma slide on you haters, hard in the paint
Bully for you, do what you can't
I might not make it, get thee behind me Satan, slab naked, drape 'em
Since yay high, notice something chasing, won't catch me running
If they clap me at a standstill, please burn this motherfucker down
Strays from the trey pound
I got a harp in my hand, a tune, strumming the cloud
Vibration changing feel like it's gonna be a situation
I knew tonight would be the end of my life
I knew tonight, I knew tonight, I'm new tonight
I knew tonight would be the end of my life
I knew tonight, I knew, I knew...
(I knew)
