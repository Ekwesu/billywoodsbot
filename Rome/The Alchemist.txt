1 ContributorThe Alchemist LyricsD to the V to the N to the C
There's alot of shit in me you can't see
Like some pee and thc
Drug testing family
At least im not in chi town
Getting murdered for glee
Maybe even murdered for a fee

It dont matter cuz the words i speak are for free
Like environments to trees
The wind will inevitably
Be lost at sea
Spying on my facebook leave me be
Going super saiyan charging my ki
Disregard my offset breed
And how my name is a T
And the last ones N
With an eye on my forehead lets pretend
That im strongest creature in the land
Take a challenge to say i can
Do anything
Cell's perfect form theres no sting
But there's boasting
With some androids in my belly roasting
Spirits ghosting
Out in the middle is where im  floating
Won't stop till im the goat and
Ill be rhyming till my end
Mind control implemented over flicker rates
140 htz thats my fate
Mash the evidence like spygate
And intake the hate
Like a democratic presidential candidate
We live for debates
And we marked the date
When the world ends
Whats our fate?
And who's the hero with a cape?
Thats just dvnc hanging from the drapes
My body is a prison that i can't escape
Spiritland provides a clean slate
Only time will tell you if i am fake
You might also like

Picture this
I got a lisp
Barely got through school
Never used an iron fist
Miss jiu jitsu so i reminisce
About the past
Drinking pink shit from a glass
Turned into an alcoholic too fast
Sucking vapors from the flask
In the middle of class
Swaded with my use of math
Brittle like a piece of glass
Thrown OUT a car going to fast
But i could still teach a class
Better then the public schools that are ass
So thats what ima do
With a face of fortitude
Dont you fucking watch the news
Hate propaganda is the fuel
Channel 2
Lies are the new
Flouride filled bamboo
Thats your brain you should cry boo hoo
Fuck weed but we love the booze
Drunk in public but i dont accuse
The few
Who refuse
To abide by the rules
The constitution is the only
Thing i listen too
1st amendment flexing fools
Tsa still touch my jewels
Thats probable cause
I can send a swat team to you moms
And say she dropping bombs
Raided flash bangs oh my god
They can even killed your dog
Should have read the epilogue
To this world thats gone way too fucking far
Thats why my bars are too hard
Blood diamonds sharp shards
Liberation seems so far
But we're lucky if we even have

Cops going full retard
But that seems makes sense
When we're dumbed down citizens
Not native english men
Indians are true americans
100 million died to preserve that sin
Made that up on a whim

Dont listen to me
Look it up yourself and you'll see
Thats how the world should be
Instead mastering the abc's
Dumbing down like 123
Obama getting ready for this ddt
For sending more troops over seas
You lied to appease
The people who back you with trees
Aka somecurrency
That REALLY dont mean shit
Petrodollars making us extinct
Trading oil for the paper by the sink
These people dont even seem to think
Look up the US petro dollar ,my people
Its time to wake upEmbed
