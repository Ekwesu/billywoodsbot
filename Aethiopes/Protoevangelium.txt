Protoevangelium Lyrics
One thing at a time
One thing at a time
One thing at a time


Life gave me lemonade, I pour in my spirit of choice
The trees weapons grade, it's not that I'm 'noid
UN inspectors upstairs, I'm tryin' not to make a noise
Wave one hand like, \All that gotta get destroyed\
I see how your man move, all him raps is null and void
Disregarded
The game thick with con artists and hucksters
Flip a cardboard box, three-card monte social justice
That's a no for me, beloved, and the rhymes are mostly rubbish
I get it
Tryna pay the rent, but that's not black empow\u0435rment
That's you tryna pay the rent
Niggas got a lot of n\u0435rve I'll give 'em that
But I don't believe a word, I see through the act
I see how you tryna switch up the past
Before you come for me brother, make sure you stop for gas


Who the cap fits
Let them wear it
Check it out
Now there's a bomb at the end of this fuse
And now we bringin' it to you live, Ghetto Network News
Live if you wanna live
Now you get what you want, do you want more?
Now you get what you want, does you want more?

I came to the end or at least my finish and they said three wishes (three wishes)
It was dark, but I could see a fire in the distance
See parables of three in every other inference, thinkin'
That night in Chinatown we got in the party, I still don't know how
Smokin' cigars across from Dr J, mine was full of haze
Everything was free, one spoke English the other Portuguese
Bed had a canopy, blood red lips and a gap in her teeth
Oh the things we shoulda did
Give me a Thanksgiving while we all still lived
Auntie Carmen's cornbread, I cooked the bird, carved the pig
Renell said bow our heads and Auntie Umi winked
I listened to them talk while I'm washin' dishes at the sink
My sister dryin'
That night Umi was cryin' so quiet, let me hug her this time
\I'm so tired\
And for the last I paused, lookin' back at the road I walked
They said come now, it's one moreEmbed
