Wharves Lyrics
Waves on wharves, war washed the poor
Never broke again, what he said on the farm
Next day they was gone
Back by nightfall, they swung in the maw
Hung by daylight, the day was long
Sweep water out with the dipper
Salt in the mouth of a river
Mangrove thickets, man's soul was broken mirrors
False witness, wolf tickets
Nowadays scavengers come before the wolf's finished
Teeth bare, bristlin', they not scared, somethin' different
The huts was empty, coal still warm in the kitchen


Cannibal tours, they came on all fours
Waterborne, eyes like Jaws
Bones litter the beach, gnawed
Cracked meat out the beast's claws
Cannibal tours, they came on all fours
Waterborne, eyes like Jaws
Bones litter the beach, gnawed
Cracked meat right out the beast's claws

Drums in the hills like sunset
The gun turret swing right to left
African Queen on the ships deck
Shipwrecked Europeans swimmin' with the virus
Shot out like God's semen
\Fuck the world\ Pac's screamin'
Crack missions for the heathens
Boats listing from the stealings
Smoke drifting from holes in the ceilings
The swollen chiefs sit, bickering while the meat crisp
The chiefs eat children, the grease drip, the meat rich
Down here it's just a muddy creek, bend and twist, the braai hiss
The fat run in rivulets, the fire spit
You might also like
Cannibal tours, they came on all fours
Waterborne, eyes like Jaws
Bones litter the beach, gnawed
Cracked meat out the beast's claws
Cannibal tours, they came on all fours
Waterborne, eyes like Jaws
Bones litter the beach, gnawed
Cracked meat right out the beast's claws
