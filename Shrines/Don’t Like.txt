Don\u2019t Like LyricsVerse One

You in the presence of a Demigod
Venemous, a death stalker scorpion crept into my telipod
Suicide in my suggestion box
Swallow live rounds, hope the fire in my belly set's 'em off
I am the legend that never was
Boom bap, bang your head until memory loss, but forget me not
Rap is dead, no signs of intelligent life but then again I haven't left the planet yet
I'm on that n\u0435gative vibe
Get th\u0435se rotten thoughts down on paper while they're still fresh in my mind, (shit)
I'll never let there be light
This is murder in the dark
Who's that on the end of my knife
It's unimportant, I put your organs up for auction
I run the gauntlet while you're having trouble walking
Saying I'm up myself, go and fuck yourself
And leave the modesty to those of you with nothing else

(Chorus)

The people that don't like my shit
Usually the same people that don't like to think
The people that don't like my shit
Usually the same people that don't like to think
The people that don't like my shit
Usually the same people that don't like to think
To the people that don't like my shit
So, what do you people know, easy come, easy go

(Yo) I'm not a man of vision, I'm a man of visions
Trance like, sketching scenes of future cataclysms
Bringing it back like atavisms
Write ring's around you, 'till you're suffering from Saturnism
Poison penmanship
A force to be reckoned with
Hit the deck until the record skip, (what)
Upgraded, nexus six
Have your life flash before your eyes and trigger epileptic fits
Should I be on this psyche ward?
When I can explain quantum theory in multi-syllabic rhyme form
You're wondering what this knifes for
I'm not comfortable in my own skin, let me try yours
I reject the Eucharist
Consume the body of Christ, fresh direct from the crucifix
Stark raving lunatic
Doomed to live
Only shoot the gift to demonstrate how bullet proof it is

(Chorus)

The people that don't like my shit
Usually the same people that don't like to think
The people that don't like my shit
Usually the same people that don't like to think
The people that don't like my shit
Usually the same people that don't like to think
To the people that don't like my shit
So, what do you people know, easy come, easy go
Verse Three

Hitch my wagon to the morning star
Walk the thin chalk outline between murder and performance art
One man show with a supporting cast
Personality split
Sawn in half
Torn apart
Fast enough to autograph a speeding bullet
Stand in front of gatling gun's
Forward march
I walk along the oceanic crust, with organic aqua lungs as you clutching at your asthma pumps
Not falling off and not falling silent
Acid tongue, lick my wounds and cauterize 'em
Filling up casket's
You had enough chances
Samurai, I keep all my head's in one basket
I make short work of you Hors d'oeuvres
Not one for warm words
My policy is scorched earth
Touch raw nerves
You catch feelings, then don't cypher with me
This is the zodiac speakingEmbed
