Leopards Lyrics
Gifted, but I ain\u2019t give him jack
Turned Jehovah\u2019s Witness on Christmas
Hardened grifters give me dap
Unscrewed\u2005the\u2005plates, left it\u2005parked up at Ditmas
Covered in tickets\u2005with two flats
You two faced dready I think different
It\u2019s more than a few ways to skin cats
Pelts drape, drip dripping, we wore the skulls as a mask
Took the boys to the forest
Shared secret stories and cut \u2018em fast
It takes blood to be a man
Blood in, blood on your hands
Blood on the leaves, blood trails where they ran
The gang's all here even if it ain\u2019t a gang
The cook pot bubble with fam pain
Bitter grains, the big man ate, but they could barely breathe
Ashy Louis the Fourteenth, crocodiles and snakes
At the masquerade, showing teeth
Masticate, make no mistake, you in the mouth of the beast


The savage in me, I can\u2019t stop
Y\u2019all made me this way
I\u2019m too far gone to turn back now
Ain\u2019t a block, nigga, I can\u2019t rock
Streets raised me this way
You know the vibe nigga, I can\u2019t stop
I said the savage in me, I can\u2019t stop
Y\u2019all made me this way
Too far gone to turn back now
Ain\u2019t a block, nigga, I can\u2019t rock
Streets raised me this way
You know the vibe nigga, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t stop

Hop out the hearse with the light feet, hyphy
I drove in solo, scroll of the night breed, die free
I dry my mobile, let me hold something in kind please
I don\u2019t own nothing, no instruction to find peace
Come again, I bust and I was born in Flushing General
Thoughts immaterial, boss what it really do?
Fire dance upon the head of the anointed
I ain\u2019t have a choice, out the smoke came the voices
I\u2019m not your boyfriend, vistas, picnics, cloisters
Black fist in moisture
(Speaking of ash, you pack the last)
I should\u2019ve listened when they told me you wasn\u2019t folk no more
Siccing his white lawyers on your boy
Season of the vic, cease and desist, real nigga, I think not
I\u2019m rehearsing for a world where you don\u2019t exist
If I\u2019m being plainspoken, k-hole slump
Under my sub slow-motion, doja boy turn token
Just when you think niggas is on the level
Performative rebel rhetoric, but the beat's incredible
Fuck it, riddle me this, lay it to rest, wait for the hex
I ain\u2019t ask for you to talk to me nice
But going silent when shit really ain\u2019t right (Nah)
Veteran dishonorable, vaginal discharge comical
Stripe, strip
Attitude don't reflect the action, tight bitch
I get my shit off when I wanna
Without centering crack or psychosomatic disorder
Who among us is not among us
In the words of arierreF .P.A.R I\u2019m seeing clearer1Embed
