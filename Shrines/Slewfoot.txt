Slewfoot Lyrics
Slow burning, all consuming, ever present movement
You choose not to see, the labor\u2019s free with\u2005hidden\u2005fees
Razors tucked under\u2005wigs and weaves, plus degrees
Buck theories,\u2005bootstrap dreams, all huff
Fumes noxious, we are bored of the apocalypse
They vision born land grabs with a sparkling eye
We\u2019re liberating vacance in the mouth of opulence
Get the fuck from \u2018round me if you ask why
Trapped with no time-outs left, Fab Five
Webber, not Freddy, death cult America, encroaching nowness
\u2018Cause we\u2019ll never be as ready as we want to
Paramilitary law and order, broke dawn
A few moments to gather your belongings
Prayers up but quickly fallen like sweat on the brow
Muscle memory, practical know-hows
Staving cynics, we\u2019re not finished


If they was me or if I had a opportunity to let these little n\u2014, uh, young  know something, I\u2019d say take care of y\u2019all money African, \u2018cause, you know what I mean, dog, take care of y\u2019all chicken, you feel me dog, take care of y\u2019all mentals, \u2018cause look, we ain't lasting that long

If you can keep your head while all around you are losing theirs


Eyes front, we play light brigade in the gaps
That dog won't hunt after the crack back
All black everything, shapes abstract after the block
Shards of light, knife sharp, lit up the night
Rushed to the dark, alligator arms
Crocodile tears at the funny farm
Most young kings get their heads chopped
(Most young kings get their heads chopped)
Colin Powell we had to get you dirty
Colin Kaepernick on the jersey
7:30, Lawrence Phillips mumbling
Something dangling in Kern Valley
Negroes run and jump and hittin' alleys
Shotgun, pistol, it\u2019ll be a new nigga next year
They won\u2019t miss you, donated brains bob gently in solution
Chris Henry just a name, Dave Duerson, flickering memory
Freeze frame, instant replay back into the Jack Kennedy
Run it back Bieniemy, boots to centipede, ten-a-piece
Fourth-in-ten, you wish you had ten of me
Thirty-for-thirty, just keep that same energy

Do you still stand by your evidence that when you met with General Abacha after your arrest on the coup, you did not kneel down before General Abacha. Do you still stand by it?

I did not kneel down before General Abacha. I pleaded with him, I pleaded with him

Now, do you still stand by your evidence?

I stand by my evidence, now what you have shown , now what you have shown does not contradict my evidence

You did not cry before General Abacha?

I did not cry before General Abacha, yes

You are also standing by your evidence that General Abacha did not give you tissue papers to wipe your tearsEmbed
