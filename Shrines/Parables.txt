Parables Lyrics
Gold plated circuitry out the mud
I couldn't fit OJ's glove
To show up Earth before the\u2005flood
Tasting\u2005my own blood
The\u2005ark was a DNA bank of\u2005fauna
A circle of crab floating atop the water
Heaven's horn bellowed Wayne Shorter
Noah didn't bear a single daughter
All the borders were liquid
World past poured at the mouth of the river bathing in whole milk
Linen and silk
Mouth full of salt and silt washing over
Dying sons of a thousand Octobers
Closer
The Father landed at the highest peak
Dead sea cliff divers saluting east
Don't let the rocks cry out first on God
Teeth and tongue on mountain face, lips and e'rything
Talkin' 'bout showing love


It's funny how significance make a difference
Notice parables of three and every other inference
It's funny how significance make a difference
Notice parables of three and every other inference
It's funny how significance make a difference (Did I ever tell you I buried my father twice?)
Notice parables of three and every other inference
You might also like
At the wake, awakened a dream
The motorcade curved like a snake through the streets
Black men in black suits, heavy heat
White handkerchief
The podium thick with liars and thieves
You were sick in your seat
Jackals was ready to eat
The hole was very neat
The second, a wound in the earth
Raw dirt, heat
The simple hut, elders often snuff
Fresh slaughtered meat
Most stiff to those gorgeous sour bear hits
Tears streaming, begging the curse to live
I was a kid
I was a young man when they buried him again
On the ancestral lands that wasn't even his
So, for you, I promise no hollow words, swallow mine
Huge birds wheel in the sky
The sea spray sting, burnin' my eyes
I won't let them bury you once

Notice parables of three and every other inference

Notice parables of three and every other inference
It's funny how significance make a difference
Notice parables of three and every other inference

Y'all, y'all
Purple hearts given out for the skilled servant
Temper out the callous with the cool minds
A fool heated
Missteps and more has got me frigid hearted
Livid over how we living
You say that we deserve better, but
Look at what we doin' for ourselves
Out us, out to get you once you can't get 'em in
That's two a piece lie advance
With the plan , fasten
The seatbelt seal upon packed pearl grasping
While you out getting bent
Crooked L, straightening my aim
Ease my cerebral, whether I'm riled up
Or still see, Solo still lethal
Radiating something different
As if I took a deep sea soak in plasma
Niggas love sleeping so much
They abandon they abortions in pajamas
My fit resembles my resilience
Piranhas can't bite through my Carhartt
Heart imbued matters more to me then a chart spot
A pot to piss in or a summer fit to scroll up
Arrive at bad decisions
Schisms is incited by a sunken system
Niggas'll claim not to see it
But your vibe can't bear what you feeling
Nigga, your expression dropped when the ball did
