 houthi Lyrics
Stood pooled in porch light
Cut my shadow off with a dull knife
Whispered in its ear, then sent it off into the night
Set the trap for the mice, the rats
Whatever's in the pipes
Corner of your eye, the edge of the white
That's where I live, I'm set for life
Braise the tripe, never stir the rice twice
Belly roasted, pancetta on a fine dice
Your wife said, \Haram,\ but we already fell from quite a height
This what happen, left to his own device
You'd be embarrassed to know the price (It wasn't much)
The bag was light, the rags was still tied tight
There was no particular gripe, I seent it all crescendo
Stepped over son when it was my turn at the window
Backwoodz single, change on plexiglass
Yeah, that's my jingle


Careful what you ask for, you just might get it
Mom showed us where she kept our passports hidden
Careful what you ask for, you just might get it
Better yet, he keep a couple passports wit' him


Told my ex-wife where I stashed it, just in case
She paused, then she said, \Okay\u201d
Couldn't think of much else to say, a labyrinth is not a maze
That's okay, but that's not the Haze
J.D. Salinger, just stay away
Miss Havisham at the drapes
Naked to the waist, aged like grapes
Guttering candles, throw shade while we ate
All you heard was knife and fork on the plate
Grainy home movies of him home-rollin' doobies
Pagliacci, how they piled in the fuckin' hooptie
Loopy smile, I ran through the town like Houthi
Wave cap under the kufi, the tea was loose-leaf
Listen, it's all news to me, I'm new in these parts
Pardon the God, I'm just visitin' my niece
Somewhere in the buildin', someone, somewhere makin' beats, muffled
Cover the mouths of children when you hear the beast, shuffle
To another door, somethin' scuttled along the floor
Belt buckle whip you raw, stood up all night
Every plan had a flaw
Pried every board from the floor
Pride before fall but he felt sure
Both hands wrapped in gauze
Stole fire from God, your Lord
And I'm just wonderin' what she was thinkin' when she paused
What she was thinkin' when she paused
You might also like
Careful what you ask for, you just might get it
Moms showed us where she kept our passports hidden
Careful what you ask for (Ask for, ask for)Embed
