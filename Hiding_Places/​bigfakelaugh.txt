 bigfakelaugh Lyrics
You mean today?


No n-words, no Irish
Shopkeeper pointed to the signage
Work sets you free on the gate, to the gate
Everything in there stretched, measured, weighed
Paid for a plate, window 'round the side
Nodded when the brother ladled extra into mines
Squatted and ate lard biscuits, fried hog rind
It was divine, right there in the Bible
All-caps, \STICK WITH YOUR OWN KIND\
Kaffir lime Arnaud\u2019s French '75, ordered in a dive
Smile taped under, murder in the eyes
She said, \You try workin' a nine-to-five, I got half a mind\
And that was the end of our time
I find it has a tendency to fly, time to ask Tyrone, do he drive?
You can\u2019t eat pride (You can try)
Social worker said, \Close your eyes
Tell me where you see yourself in five, then write it down
Come on guys, it's just a thought exercise\
She walked down the rows, she had thick thighs
Big hips, ass kinda flat, but that's fine
Covered my answer 'cause fuck these other muh\u2014 (Fuck 'em)
Before the jig's up, need every red cent
And more than a few dimes (More than a few dimes)

'Fore they dig him up, need a lawyer and an alibi
Before we pull the jux, let 'em know I\u2019m camera-shy
Rooms full of books, used to wonder what\u2019s inside
Run my hands down the spine, now I sit saturnine


I got a letter from my insurer the other day
Opened and read it (\This has gotta be good news\)
Said that the treatment wasn't covered
Turned to the family like, \I guess just forget it\ (\Just forget it\)
Big fake laugh (\Ah, hahahahaha!\)
This ain\u2019t a Denzel movie, don't try to think fast
Don't start changin' lanes, get yourself whiplashed
Oh look, got yourself a shit bag (\Oh, whaddya know?\)


\u2019Fore they dig him up, need a lawyer and an alibi
'Fore we pull the jux, let 'em know I'm camera-shy
Room full of books, used to wonder what's inside
That was before, now out of sight, out of mind (And I don't mind)


Really wanna keep it a secret? Hide it from yourself (Out of mind)
Hid it as a child, now his arm too big to reach it
Took the baby out her arms, wade into the deep end
Waited for dad to come home, turned to evenin'
Tree limbs skim the water, the dark deepen
The car swerve, rainy season
The regime purge, leakin'
Cold, teeth chatterin', that's life leavin'
The Demiurge, well beyond reason
The Urn Grecian, this is just bookkeepin'
It's no bottom like crooked policemen
Water unseasonably warm for the long weekend
My father prepared a place and waited in a storm of spirits
We was delivered
My father's house has many rooms
Mr. Biswas at the bend in the river
Swimmin' now, you was born knowin'
Born with the caul, all eyes open
My mother made me promise to bring her body to the ocean
Not here, but warm Caribbean waters
In Africa, you leave twins in the forest
My sister had the courage to pay for us

Before they set us up, need a lawyer and an alibi
Before we do the gig, let him know I'm camera-shy
Shelves full of books, it's a secret passageway on the other side
Surprise, surprise
Before they set us up, need a lawyer and a- (Surprise, surprise)
Let 'em know (Surprise, surprise)
I'm camera-shy (Surprise, surprise)2Embed
