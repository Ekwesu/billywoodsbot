 bedtime Lyrics
One night e'ry woman came up out her grave
Or wherever she was put, murdered, some cleverly hidden place
Niggas was hidin' behind drapes (Arguing)
Tryna load a .38
Went to shoot, I'm like, \What that gonna do?
That bullet's for you, trust, you don't want to see her face\
The monsters ate
I'm a hyena, so it's nothing to wait
Played the back, log in the fire crack
Shadows dance about the cave
They gave the shadows names
Give men freedom, they'll beg for chains, beg for change
Ain't no bedtime, Mama on cocaine


One mornin' all grown-ups was missin'
Once it dawned on 'em, kids ate all the snacks in the kitchen
'Less they was poor, then they went in the store, took all that and more
Ridin' shoppin' carts like bumper cars
Go-karts, how they did the Saab
Wasn't no cops, Air Force, or Al-Shabaab
'Less you talkin' toy guns in the backyard
In which case, they was goin' hard
Obviously, school was out
No inside voices, scream and shout
The world's a playground
First kiss on the mouth, forgot to be embarrassed
But the sun crept
Thinking of that empty house as the shadows stretch
The dog ran off, didn't come back yetYou might also like1Embed
