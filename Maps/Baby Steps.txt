Baby Steps Lyrics
Kansas City, Missouri to Lincoln, Nebraska
Ten hour layover in Chicago?
I don't know, man, your call
I'm not gonna be able to do it


I actually took a $300 Uber to a show
Asleep in the back like Future, might as well be a Maybach
Showed up with nothing but a computer, let's go
Glowed up, looking like she covered in gold dust
Must not have re-upped her Lexapro
I don't check in, but if you feel a disturbance in the force, you already know
Somethin' wicked in the wind
Just picture me sittin' with a pen in a cloud of smoke
Front row at your live set just to determine if it's a hoax
My love languag\u0435 an obscure dialect
Pulled m\u0435 aside, explained she was just doing a bit, I was like, \Oh\
Dispensary provide the per diem
Gimme the loot, it's a museum
Dien Bien Phu, my opps pass each other coming and leaving
My ph\u1edf steaming
Oxtail and lemongrass, steak still bleeding
Cocktails and cake tiers, it's always wedding season
Breasts out for the feeding, feeling vulgar
Large areolas, bite like I'm teething (Baby steps)
You might also like
Baby, you and I 
Baby, you and I 
Baby, you and I
Baby, you and I


Oi, oi
I'm on a quiet block after dark banging all the noise
The Abyssinians pay no mind
Some sleep, flames dance, others hide
Spilled guts in the street, heads draped under white cowl, dingy
Torch play light and shadow
Haunted arrow whistle, pierce flesh, bone, and marrow
Red and blue flash, zombies scatter
Wax moon hover, full as a DivaCup
I score goblins to get right, getting fuzzy
Beats bang melancholic
Chanting, \Eat a dick up\ 'til you hiccup
It's a formal invite, I know I'm wilin'
Clouds get violent too
Must every tree I plant bear fruit?
Filth and fury rotten
Grace came for dummies
Salt to suck the toxin
True north, shotgun, triple option
The blessing blocker, the constant gardener
You spit the Our Father backwards
Cracked up, jump start the rapture
Scabs and scars, no veins to spike
Heart and self
You got somethin' for me?
You got somethin' for me? (I mean yeah I'd do it)
You got somethin' for me?
You got somethin' for me? ( yeah I'd do it, I'd do it)Embed
