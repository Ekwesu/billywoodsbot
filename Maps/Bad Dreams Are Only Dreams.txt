Bad Dreams Are Only Dreams Lyrics
Jet-lag, I can't quite grab the new me
Old self dozing in an aisle seat
Emirates, where I left him, daydreams treacherous ephemera
Brain exposed to the elements
Lift my skull top off delicate
Bone china chafing dish
Absent minded break time like bricks, thoughts is cinder blocks
Alarm clocks break spells
Crashed out, search for my own black box in the hills
Scorched earth scoured like cook pots, mangled wheels, strewn debris
Hours in a wristwatch bust down, dancing in the piece
Private dancers dance for me
King\u2019s ransoms, it ain't no rides that's free
Half \u2019sleep with the halo, dead on my feet
