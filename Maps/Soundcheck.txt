Soundcheck Lyrics
I will not be at soundcheck
I will not be in the green room if it's too lit
Could be at the local greasy spoon or Szechuan establishment
Courtyard by Marriott bathroom, blowing marijuana through the vents
Shower on, weed sauna
I will not be at soundcheck, but I might check in to keep 'em honest
I reserve the right (I might)
Is it rap beef or is it on sight?
Talking out they teeth, don't even know what I look like
I think I'ma be aight
I'ma do the damn thing tonight
Please be advised, I will not be at soundcheck, not on your life
Just cut the mic on and kill the lights
Nikon flash, my face is the mask
Develop the photograph but som\u0435thing just wasn't quite (That's weird, can't see it)
I will not be at soundch\u0435ck
Might watch the sunset over your city from a parapet or a park bench
Headlamps splash squatter tents on my way to the venue, they wave me in
I'm from where bottles got smashed over ya head in the spot, I'm tense
I'm smiling like I'm not, I'm surfing through the set
After curtains, I sit for a while before I go get the check


Every victory pyrrhic, every, every live show forget the lyric
Every victory pyrrhic, every live show forget the lyric
Every victory pyrrhic, every, every live show forget the lyric
Every victory pyrrhic, every, every, every, every, every live show we forget the lyric
You might also like
I will not be at soundcheck, buddy I'm hemping
Me and the crew in this five-seater we renting
Make sure the mic's right like Phil Jackson in '96
Show up for doors, grab a couple Coors, then might dip
I know a couple plugs in this town I get right with
Go shopping when the plane land, I might catch tonight's fit
See every time I rhyme, it's something timeless and priceless
Shit, for soundcheck, the engineer should cop a full price ticket
My DJ scratch the records like lice in it
We seasoned vets, I'm in the telly, sock with hot rice in it
Lauryn Hill, fuck your curfew, come and chill
Jay Elec, talk a whole set and kill it still
This a meal ticket, stop tripping like you paying mills
And if I do check it, just know you're witnessing the real
Then after my set, you might as well go 'head shut it down
'Cause ain't nobody else gon' burn it down like I burn it down
You know
You already know, they already know


Every victory pyrrhic, every live show forget the lyric
Every victory pyrrhic, every, every live show forget the lyric
Every victory pyrrhic, every, every, every, every, every live show we forget the lyricEmbed
