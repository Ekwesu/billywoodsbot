As the Crow Flies Lyrics
Everybody cooking, I'm just cleaning up my kitchen
Emptying the fridge, bleaching counters, sweeping corners
I be in my drawers aligning my silverware in order
Couple hours, I'll be waiting at the gate
Under influence, 10k and rising
In the valley of the sun, I'm a force without a name
I been tripping through coordinates, just have my cordless hot
A whisky sour, ice, what it is, what it's not
By the time I get to Arizona
I didn't come with instruction
In this season of revealing, burning everything that doesn't serve
Sometime I feel before remembering
It's really him, my wife told the man, I didn't want the joke to end
Didn't want that joke to end
Rainbow rubber band, rusty razor blade, traveling mercy
Feeling blood get thicker, Bo Jackson jersey
The rep grows bigger
I took out my gold fronts
Split a rack of rib with the illest, not counting myself
Baggage on the carousel loop, big body blur, side of the truth
Landing somewhere in the middle
It's a physical experience, a realist ritual of niggarati lineage
Rooted, but I roam free
Dopp kits and QR codes be all I see
The WiFi's weak, smoke detector beeps
In between the takes, I rap like good daddy
Sweating out my silk shirt, asking, \What's the real work?\
Hahaha, yeah, yeah

I'm in the park with the baby on the swing
When it hits me crazy, anything at all could happen to him
He been climbing higher and higher on the jungle gym
Running faster, sometimes pushing other kids
Tear-streaked apologies, balled fists, it's a trip
That this is something we did
I kiss her on the lips
I watch him grow, wondering how long I got to liveEmbed
