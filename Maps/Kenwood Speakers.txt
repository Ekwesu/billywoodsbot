Kenwood Speakers Lyrics
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow but I got time today


After-market speakers in the Saturn
Beater but they can't catch her
Binoculars to they peepers
Wire tap sound like Buju Banton
Fire trap if the only exit where I'm standing
Cold lampin'
Bed Stuy, got one eye on them guys
The other on a crumbling mansion
If it's gon' get gentrified, I'm not trying to leave it empty-handed
Blue-eyed white walkers in King's Landing
The way I'm running, should be kissing babies and glad-handing
I'm running routes, trees and patterns
I'm walking in the streets 'cause the rats is madness
Veneers on the teeth like, \Nigga, we made it\
Wreathed in gas, I'm a carburetor
Every time things going good or having a laugh
Have to remember God's a hater
Crocodile Tears for ten years plus, don't do me no favors


Dinner party with the neighbors
Their apartment's renovated
Skate wing, brown butter and capers
Sprigs of thyme
Heavy pours of natural wine
I turn the music up incrementally and told mischievous lies
I whispered in the host's ear all night
I hear they found him in the morning
Hose run from the exhaust pipe
