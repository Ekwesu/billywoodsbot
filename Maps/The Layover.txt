The Layover Lyrics
Already knew the options was lose/lose
Baby, that's nothing new
That just make it easier to choose, it's up to you
If it's on your mind, just ask, you don't need to hunt for clues (Police activity)
Phone demagnetized the key to the room
Magpies pluck jewels out my tombs
Gadfly, watch them guys fume
Nine lives, Whitey wondering how many I already used
Devil may care, but inside I'm wondering too
Finally got it to where lies is the truth and the truth is a ruse
Original sin, unopened, n\u0435ar mint, to grin in the gloom
The block spin, the car do\u0435sn't move
Black death, rubbernecking pale faces
Handkerchief soaked in perfume
Posthumous YouTube views
Lion at the bottom of a well looking up at a circle of blue


In all candor, I got one foot in your grave
Light work by lantern, I still call a shovel a spade
Giant panda, big grass all in my face
Walking with the panther, going back to Cali
Deion Sanders and I'm going back the other way
In all candor, I got one foot in your grave
Light work by lantern, I still call a shovel a spade
Giant panda, big grass all in my face
Walking with the panther, going back to Cali
Deion Sanders and I'm going back the other way
You might also like
Parts Unknown, at home when the road's not paved
Little piece of yard, couple goats graze
The live show is t-shirt and jeans, but it's GWAR when I'm off stage
No bars, just a cavalcade
Trapped cars tap in once they hit the Palisades
Big jar when you donate my brain
Spicy chili oil, let that bad boy marinate
No Reservations, walked in like Bourdain
The game was horseshoes, I brought hand grenades tired of the close shaves
Before History, I made fire in the cave
Midwifery, delivery a ball of rage
Hide and go seek, some never find a hiding place
Some kids hid so well, they never found a trace
It's too late, but they came all the same
Eyes begging for something for the pain


In all candor, I got one foot in your grave
Light work by lantern, I still call a shovel a spade
Giant panda, big grass all in my face
Walking with the panther, going back to Cali
Deion Sanders and I'm going back the other way
In all candor, I got one foot in your grave
Light work by lantern, I still call a shovel a spade
Giant panda, big grass all in my face
Walking with the panther, going back to Cali
Deion Sanders and I'm going back the other wayEmbed
