Soft Landing Lyrics
Excuse me, uh, on those drinks?


It's 2:1:1 on the daiquiris
It ruins the whole day when my baby mother mad at me
Spliff could prolly jump your car battery
Birds-of-paradise in the menagerie
A single death is a tragedy but eggs make omelets
Statistics how he look at war casualties
Killin' is one thing, what sticks is how casually
Nonchalant, 5 in the morning, what I grew up on
God bless this sweet home, my beloved heart
124 bluestone crouched on thin haunch
While I get dome from the living
Conch fritters crispin' in the kitchen
Grew gaunt in prison
My own warden, celly, and superintendent
Flaunt flagrant disassociation
Dissonant cadence
Free political dissidents from they cages
But leave 'em open
We got lists of names, pages and pages
Wouldn't want to waste the space the previous regime gave us
This message is to inform you your service will be suspended
For non-payment
Midnight ravens
Head in the loud clouds, both feet on the fuckin' pavement
You might also like
Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on, you know how I feel
Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on, you know how I feel


My daily routine narrated by an Attenborough
Over the instrumental to \Keep It Thoro\
My chain banged glass ceilings, Joe Burrow
When the contract came, white man read while I sit, brow furrowed
Rappers leaned out
2nd Amendment with the beam
It worked for William Burroughs
It could be nuclear winter with an earthquake
The worst people'll wiggle out the rubble
Maybe \Suicidal Thoughts\ was the \Everyday Struggle\
For a brief, sweet, moment it was nothing in the thought bubble
From up here the lakes is puddles
The land unfold brown and green, it's a quiet puzzle
Before we take off, I call mom and say, \I love you\
Complimentary beverages
When we land, I text my ex and say\u2014

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Amsterdam where the local time is 6:30. Please remain seated with your seatbelts fastened until the signs have been switched off. And as a reminder, messaging, calls, or internet access must remain switched off until\u2014


Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on, you know how I feel
Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on, you know how I feel
