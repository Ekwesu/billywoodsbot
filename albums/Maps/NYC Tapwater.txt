NYC Tapwater Lyrics
You lack the minerals and vitamins
One sip of New York City tapwater, I'm back dialed in
Last car in the last train, we piled in
Pack lasted three days, azithromycin
I miss this place \u2019til I'm back, long face to match
My cats are strays, but the rats too big to catch
Lapped the B48 in a foot race, bus driver tried to play the kid
You know I'm not goin\u2019 out like that (Crazy)
Since I've been gone, it's a new panhandler outside the store
Inside, young boy goin' through every bag of grabba like it's raw silk cloth
Few weeks later, see my guy from before
Few streets up outside Kennedy, fried, grinding his jaw
He ain't recognize me at all
Jet-lagged, I slipped in the bar at last call
Crabs in a bucket, how the fuck I escape them claws?
Survivor's guilt with a side of buyer's remorse
I\u2019m home, but my mind be wandering off


Sometimes I don\u2019t tell anyone I'm back around
Just lay low, crack a fresh pound
The cat miss me the most, purring loud on my lap
Tranquilo, fragrant smoke lazy in the air
Fingers steepled, wondering if I really need all this stuff I got in here
Through the peephole, I see new people going up and down the stairs
New buildings just appear
I mighta seen Don Cheadle, Cookies and Runtz everywhere
But what I wouldn\u2019t give for a piece of that '08 sour diesel
That popcorn, green on green on green
Where I used to cop at, now it's a Blue & Cream (I see you Jeff)
Four hundred dollar Japanese jeans (They're actually very comfortable)
Meanwhile, my bodega akh selling weed (No thanks, man)
Bird\u2019s eye chili seeds dot the chicken, off the block Guyanese rice and peas
Cops ride by and be in the breeze
No need for stop and frisk, it's cameras everywhere, they got your IG feed
Come scoop kids after they do the deed (Real fast)
Death in a top hat dance a jig in the street
Don't get it twisted boy, the city wicked, it'll crush you with its feet
