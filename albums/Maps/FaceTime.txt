FaceTime Lyrics
Ready to die, it's no Biggie
No surprise, no pity
Lived a couple lives, go ahead and slide, hope I take a couple with me
Made a couple dollars it got tricky quickly
What you expect?
Play stupid games you flyin' easyJet
Bratislava, Utrecht
Something felt off before I even left
So when I saw the missed calls, I knew what was next
Didn't have to open the text
Stupid prizes, couple's therapy on Zoom
It's a train wreck
My evil eye ward off hex though
FaceTime declined, I'm trying to live in the moment like death row
The sunset in the desert, red glow, redness in the west
I sip Mexico's best slow, Mezcal Negroni
Sittin' atop the corral smokin', watching unbroken wild ponies
Run wild at sundown
Only the lonely big tree like a sundial


Continental breakfast, stick and weave, tuck and roll
I can't take you with me, but I be on your phone
You can take it out anytime you wanna know where I've been goin'
Nothin' out in Texas feels like weeks on the road
Pissed in Mississippi, stopped in New Mexico
I ain't seen my folks
And strangely I feel right at home on my own
You might also like
Three oboes, one clarinet
Black rainbows, the night wept
The room smelled like Marrakesh
Dubstep drift in the window, I sit at the desk
It's a party outside, some half, some overdressed
They was goin' off during Playboi Carti set
Now they in the halls partyin'
Checkin' they phones, bass shake the walls
I'm smokin' alone in a cardigan
Thinkin' of home
The cannabis single origin waffle cone
Went back down to the bar again wig blown
Afterparty packed like Parliament
Asscheeks and cheekbones, lips slightly parted
Butter wouldn't melt, I gave 'em margarine
I'm lookin' like the help or someone who just wandered in
The vibe is animal pelts
Chunky rings, clunky shoes, lots of ink
Dudes who order everybody's drink
Really I'm just waiting for my phone to ping
I'm thinkin' 'bout you when I'm supposed to be thinkin' 'bout other things
I don't go to sleep, I tread water 'til I sink


Continental breakfast, stick and weave, tuck and roll
I can't take you with me, but I be on your phone
You can take it out anytime you wanna know where I've been goin'
Nothin' out in Texas feels like weeks on the road
Pissed in Mississippi, stopped in New Mexico
I ain't seen my folks
And strangely I feel right at home on my own

On my own
On my own
On my own3Embed
