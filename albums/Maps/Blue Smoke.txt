Blue Smoke Lyrics
Over time symbols eclipse the things they symbolize
I sympathize, but read the contract before you sign, son
We not even in contact, but still have to hear all this motherfucker's lies, dun
Shouldn't be surprised, don't let me catch you unsupervised
Pushing every button, just remember, it's no rewind
Mind you, you never met a nicer group of guys than mine
Even when it got mean, the bud was kind
Indoors when y'alls was outsid\u0435
Johannesburg in a Ford Explorer, just rem\u0435mber this the Fourth of July
Boerewors on the braai, this the wrong part of town to be driving by
Crack it wide, that's suicide doors on your ride
Electric fence, big ass satellite dish pointed at the sky
So much tape hiss, FBI agents narrow they eyes
Frustrated, asking to be reassigned
\Been on this n-word for months, I think it's all just rhymes.\
I'm still peaking, and if it's just us speaking, these n-words is on the decline
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha, I'm teasing, man)
Thick smoke, I took the honeycomb out the hive
No disrespect to your mans and them, but I'll actually do it live
Learned the hard way motherfuckers'll run in shooting after we spent months trying to strategize
The pork belly was brined, braised, then deep fried
Fresh mint, Thai basil, pickled watermelon rind
Julienned scallions and other alliums, gave the pepper mill one grind
Noncommittal when she said she'd cook next time
