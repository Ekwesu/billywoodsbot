Houdini Lyrics
We're gonna need more weed, I can tell you that


Day off, big vibes
Big ideas, still have to kick the tires
The kick was wide, time expired
I fell out, wasn't even tired
That's why I don't even really mess with OG, but this one taste like fresh papaya
Since the spot got a grill, you know I'm working the fire
If it's cool in the shade, I'ma chill
If it's cool with you, I'ma hit my supplier
If it's any beef, today a good day for a cease fire
Or, if not, creep, shoot to kill, hit or miss, get a good night's sleep 'cause now it's gon' be on for real
I'm at a Costco in the midwest with a pock\u0435t full of small bills
Folded like tacos, borracho
El Chapo when it's tim\u0435 to head for the hills
Gazpacho on the veranda, trust me I know it's hot in the fields
Jimmy Wopo draped over his steering wheel


I was high all day, I escaped
I was high all day, I escaped
I was high all day, I escaped
I was high all day
You might also like
The nose is Pine-Sol and turpentine
But the taste remind me of Jamaican oranges that look like limes
Pit stop turned into the whole night
Honestly, we wasn't looking at the time
Where I'm from, you don't see fireflies
Smell burning in the air, wildfires backlighting the sky
Used to be you could have your opinion and I could have mine
I'm arguing for a new paradigm
Just say he's the best, here's where you sign
A lot of people gon' be upset, but in the end it'll be fine
The earth is a sphere (You don't have to believe it)
I do work
The cats working with mirrors, I disappear
I was never there (Officer)
Walked into the forest filled with fear
Couldn't see it coming, but I could hear
Something lumbering near
Woke up sudden in armchair
Cousin like, \Yo, you good to drive?\
Nigga, I'm the tip of the spear


I was high all day, I escaped
I was high all day, I escaped
I was high all day, I escaped
I was high all dayEmbed
