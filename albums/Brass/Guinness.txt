Guinness Lyrics
On the TV, I see fire in their eyes
Fire in the streets from the firescape
I watch it eat, I watch it's teeth
Dream fire could burn it clean
But its greasy sheen burn blue and green
Build their house with bricks
Scraped the mortar in between
You don't need a door if you get e'rything you need
Need more, first thought when I get the cream
Cold light pourin' from the screens
Mute, it's the eyes where you hear the screams
Bags full of loot bulgin' at the seams
Everything a little shabbier than it seems
Than it seems, shabbier than it seems, than it seems
Took it all and came home empty, they won't go gently
The whole world in my mobile, it took centuries
The glow unending, the show upended
Like cop cars spooked by the door, I'm a sentry


Smash, grab and run, smash, grab and run
Smash, grab and run, smash, grab and run
Grab and run, grab and run, sma-
Smash, grab and run, grab and run, grab and run
Smash, grab and run, smash, grab and run
Smash, grab and run, smash, grab and run
Smash, grab and run, grab and run, grab and run
Grab and run, grab and run, grab and run, grab and run

We are becoming bureaucrats, because there has never been, you know, wait a minute, we are, we, our generation has got a lot of problems. There has never been a tradition of us writing, whereby people just sit and be able to live and write. In any case you know that from anyway, anyway
No, no, my point is...
The point is, now we are trying to earn our living and write at the same time
Yes but, you see, um, um, points of principles (laughter) cannot be given up just because one has got to eat
I'm not, I don't see which principle I have given at all, I see...Embed
