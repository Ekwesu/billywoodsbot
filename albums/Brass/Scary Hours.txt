Scary Hours Lyrics
Xenophobia in Wakanda
They'll truck you to the Botswana border
And tell you you're deported
In Kinyarwanda
You get one warnin', get one warnin'
They found Dian Fossey face down in the mornin'
Wet market, hagglin' over human organs
Cordon sanitaire, the west sick and swollen
Cracked lips, bloated feet bulgin', sick with rabies
Inoculate the babies, inoculate the babies
It's too late for y'all, just inoculate the babies
Inoculate the babies
Product of the '80s
1885, cut the pie, red fillin' spillin' in Berlin
Sickly white men clad in animal skins
African Kings, flies swarm on piles of limbs
Inoculate the babies, inoculate the babies


Who's gon' save the babies, from all the caging?
The truthless staging, where's your rage?
We all follow the bloody line
From 1919 to present time
Master by the clock
The watch watched us watch us 
You might also like
Hold up, I'm runnin', I'm comin'
I'll see you in twenty, my feet are in front of me
Long live love, and the melody
We sink into the sub, the submachine
The king of love is dead, long live the king


Last night it was ten shots, one body
Last night it was ten shots, broke the hearts of everybody
Retaliate? Yeah probably
Pigs gonna get hurt, not sorry
Welcome to the party, welcome to the party
The trumpets are blarin'
I climb up the ivory tower
I see a new heaven now
Carbon copy, future bound
Fugitive gag sound
I know where I am right now
Can you tell me where I am right now?
They drawin' the lines right now
On the map
Dividing the rivers and mountains up that ain't never been found
I hope they don't find me
I hope they don't find me
My head on a bounty
Drawin' the lines around me, captive county
The queen of love's not dead
Exile in Lagos
The protest remember what you said, they aim for your head
At home at safe in your bed
Last night it was 2Pac, hail Mary
They got eight cops, devil hours get scary
All eyes on me, but I hope you fear me
All eyes on me, but I hope you hear meEmbed
