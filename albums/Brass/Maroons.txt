Maroons Lyrics
And of course, no such thing as danger, without purity, no such thing as blackness...


Caravans\u2005crisscrossin'\u2005dunes
And ants crawlin\u2019\u2005on the face of the moon
And\u2005599 Trelawny Maroons marooned in the snow and gloom
In Nova Scotia colder than a tomb
And sour stinkin' handkerchiefs soaked in perfume
Female flowers drinkin' in Hairouns and
I need a big gyal dem, let me be the little spoon and
No white saviors, look what happened to the Cubans
Reluctantly sold bud to my white neighbors when they moved in
Yup that\u2019s right, harbingers abound
Locusts swarmin', you can't see the ground
The sun blotted out
The sound of plague rattlin' against the house


I knew it was over when I dropped a quarter in the class
Washington headass lookin' at me like, you outta gas
But what about the oil rivers?
Diamond mine  glitters
H&H and all his bitches
Serpere witch riches
The queen of England still in voodoo scriptures
Paintin' foggy ass pictures of John D, crowd shoulda came strippin'
He don't know no now
And you don\u2019t know me
Hottentot, T rounds clippin\u2019
Tar(?) babies spittin'
In the face of the Klan, in the face of your man
In the kingdom of Ham
Son of climate change, Noah
Allowed to pick and choose in the Torah, my Lord
I\u2019m just a blood pourer
Ten seconds left with the Earth in my hand
I'm the go-to sorcerer
You might also like
It's a race
The longest race that's ever been known
Skull and bone, chaos and tone
The bell tolled, ringing ears with religion
Calculated division from the clocktower
You see the blood bank glisten


Moonstone, glistening silver silhouette
Of what\u2019s lurking
Whispering in the shadows
Corrupt must, old spice, blood moon
The clock flocks like doves
Crying was what killing is now
Fat rendered down in the slow process of change coming
Interlocking around sounds, spinning disks
Moorish architecture, inside voices
Don't let them get ahold of the word
Let alone the design2Embed
