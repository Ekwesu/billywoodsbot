Gang for a Day Lyrics
Numb fumblin' Fats Walker
Feel like a little girl lookin' up at the system like
Damn, your feets too big
Reptilian heads circlin' around the sun
New school, like eh dun, your gang sign's weak
R.I.P. to the beat down (For the homies, right?)
I guess I'm throwing up 80 East now (That's what they say, right?)
For the homies


Poured the whole bottle on the ground
Still woozy off the beat down
Grey meat inside the C-town
Quarter ki in the lost and found
'long with a thousand umbrellas
A hundred mismatched gloves
One solitary shoe
Peter S\u0435llers in the club, my black face th\u0435 elephant in the room
They wanna be gang for a day
We on that wire when you get waved
It's all just talk 'til you get paid
And even then, is what E L U C I D say, said
Don't mind me, I be hearin' the voices in your head
Don't mind me, I be hearin' the voices in your head
You might also like
Simple and plain, put that thing on your brain
Make it go blah, make it rain with the pain
Method to the madness
I ain't holdin' no signs for change
I ain't got no part, no name
I ain't give a fuck about they game
I'm feelin' the magic, ain't never been savage
This shit is so tragic, this whole shit is so tragic
They can take it, can have it
I only write for the dead, somethin' E L U C I D said
Wrong words get you cracked in the head


Fresh out the womb, they jump you in
Family in the waitin' room, blood thick then thin (Colors)
Blood drip on the starter (Colors)
Blood thicker than water
Mom said, \don't let anybody take what's ours\
In other words, don't come home without it
I thought she was angry, now I know it was fear
Every home a trap house when you think about it (Colors)
Ancestors is there, every room crowded
Blood thud in my ears when they say you look like how he did (Colors, colors, colors)
The gang's all here, the blood's all shared
The love is real, the love is there
I thought she was mad, now I know she was just scared

Flag on the dome, flag on the door, flag in the air
Flag on the dome, flag on the door, flag in the air
Flag on the dome, flag on the door, flag in the airEmbed
