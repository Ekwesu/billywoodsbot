Rapunzal Lyrics
Occluded moons
Black flowers at the tomb
Speakers hiss in empty nightclubs, the city hum
Tinnitus
Flyness on your eardrum
Mosquitoes biased
Sickle Cell have him hesitant to try it
Solomon and Midas
Assassins need tyrants, the virus
Circling planes with no pilots, no drivers
Trains runnin' riot
Yellowin' ads for new diets
LED displays, Pricewaterhouse
Come see what we can do for you
Watch your step in the slaughterhouse
Street's wet, but it's over now
Death in an evening gown
Modest heel and he had a crown (Of sorts)
Alan Greenspan fuckin' Ayn Rand
She came, finished him with her hand
Lit a cigarette, they split in the dark
Men sang from minarets, but we'd already hardened our hearts


Rapunzel's hair kept growin' and the nails
It was quiet 'cept the ocean fog like a veil
Rapunzel's hair kept growin' and the nails
It was quiet 'cept the trees moanin' as the sun failed
You might also like
Come see what we can do for you
Watch your step in the slaughterhouse
We let death past curfew
Watch your mouth in my momma's house
The night ran quiet and the riot
Darkness guided, through the air like Kobe Bryant
'08 season, the year after Garnett screaming
\Anything is possible\
\That's physics,\ said the knight apostle
Black and gospel
Flip the card and the fortune fell
Seven of swords yelled
\I can take one more\
The blood pulse, I commend mi amor
It's what we're in for
They up twenty, so they stopped the board
Grab a stick, bust a hole through the core
This bitter Earth
A billion eyes act like sores
Achin', the puss poured
Bubblin', the ocean
Castle in the sand
Offshore commission
Closed eyes see bliss
While the righteous sharpen swords in the mist
It was quiet, except the sirens yelled
On some Ol' Dirty shit, Ason parallel
(Ason)

Rapunzel's hair kept growin' and the nails
It was quiet 'cept the ocean fog like a veil
Rapunzel's hair kept growin' and the nails
It was quiet 'cept the trees moanin' as the sun failed1Embed
