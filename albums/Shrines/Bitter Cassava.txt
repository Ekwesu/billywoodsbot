Bitter Cassava Lyrics
Lord help me I feel like the RZA
Like, this what I get for helping you\u2005niggas?
Before\u2005the game start\u2005you rig it
Right before my part\u2005they pulled blickas
Niggas predictable, they go left but can't finish
Sheetrock thin, neighbors in my business
Annie Lennox, Al Green penance
I'm a black hole, I'm a light bender
Water cold I\u2019m a night swimmer
One baobab in the desert
Fire woods for the peasant poach the king\u2019s pheasant
Roast over open coals, no kitchen
Piles of cracked chicken bones, the neighbor goat missing
Ochre out the throat where the blade kissed him
Entrails spilt, there was never a vision
There was never nothing in 'em
The sky was indifferent, the ground hold bitter cassava
They lie 'bout the loaves and the fishes
But not that road to perdition, woo


You ain't never had it in front of your face
Lies told, you don't know how that cornbread taste
Shit old, I ain't got another hand to waste
Big biz, still digging like I know I ain't saved
Been 'round the way, in the hood I'm good
I'm around the way, walking fade, bittersweet
You might also like
Teaching my kid to throw the peace sign
Thumb god double dare green slime
Run for it, run for it, come through, big chief, him bad, kung fu
Undo, plum fool, I been dumbing out
Bet it on the house, wiretapping my style
Yeah, I been at it for a while
Y'all been holding out, then pop up unannounced, pounce
I wake to a jet beauty in a weave bonnet
Boil blending oil to please our scalp
Just a drip of each, I keep moving east
Rising up out of reach, unacknowledged and I'm in need
Please don\u2019t call me king, no
We can't have all the things
Terabyte, gigabyte, niggas bite
I heard ass taste better in the summertime, split her thigh
Thunder in the sky rolling wide
Spun a vibe that didn\u2019t feel like
You were running for time or from it
Fireflies in the jar, poke a hole so I can breathe
Steez hard to earn get up off your knee
See, I'm not the one to lean on
I'll give you what you need


You ain't never had it in front of your face
Lies told, you don\u2019t know how that cornbread taste
Shit old, I ain\u2019t got another hand to waste
Deep end, still digging like I know I ain\u2019t saved
Been 'round the way, in the hood I'm good
I'm around the way, in the hood I'm good
I'm around the way, in the hood I'm good
I'm around the way, in the hood I'm good
I'm around the way, bittersweet1Embed
