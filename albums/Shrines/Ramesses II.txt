Ramesses II Lyrics
Shit shout out to sky like Warren Moon did it
Blood on the trees, blood on\u2005the\u2005leaves
Lady day and\u2005the meek eating no ford
Why dipper\u2005mouth blowing snot
In the Hermes cloth of Jesus
Satched the cleanest since he copped his lace from the priest
In this tree from Jefferson County in the spaghetti roads
The most drip saints marching in
Since Toussaint with the machette
Giving body blows the beast, kept the crackers on a leash
Jesus piece, now come here
Get three-fifths a slice of this Africa cake
Diamonds south of savan I mean the pussy of Africa
Matriarchal golden crown, drum on water
Sky walker, I\u2019m like Nina in the jungle with diamonds
I'm a Black Panther knife to the neck of King Leopold
The glamorous life, yeah


Cascading communications of no significance whatsoever
Waves of pleasure, thought you had the best til you taste better
Taste butter, the tailor tape measure touch like a lover
Doormen\u2019s faces blend into one another
Glass panels in the sky, with the sound off
Even when you drive you fly, they rarely touch the Porsche
I never saw it, just sat stage right
The stage perfectly lit, no time for stage fright
The private jet, the landing strip
Every follicle plugged and trimmed
Zero-sum so somebody gots to win
You don\u2019t understand the quiet it bring
Deafening, you can\u2019t hear a thing
Sinking seats, everything got wings
Signal\u2019s weak, sleep in Faraday Cage
Carrying in curve beak, she in the family way
You might also like
The skin of my teeth, the hem of my pants
Eyes baggy, wire transfer hemorrhaging blood money bags
Under the eyes, gotta crash, display stolen artifacts
Talking \u2018bout a bargain, I\u2019ma barter back
Contraband adapting with the path, forgot the plan
Roll up on a map, I know where I am
Bloodstain on my father\u2019s father\u2019s land
A dirt raise ramps




Never learned how to whistle, still can\u2019t do the moonwalk
I\u2019m running red lights and I hate to have my picture taken
Catch me in the corner not speaking
Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have much to say
I bet you can\u2019t tell when I\u2019m tweaking
My anxiety don\u2019t look like yours
I just relearned escape, hands on my lady\u2019s waist
Got a sitter, made a date
Where we at is the place of the most high
Who no know gon\u2019 know now, no doubt
We got on like a house on fire
A testimony ain\u2019t nothing but
Being wild and living to tell the story
\u201919 naughty now, my uncle on a 40-run
Sawed-off on the three-quarter level
Niggas never saw it coming
All CashApp donations go toward my gold fang fund
My appreciation for your participation
Overstanding no such thing as spare change
Blank faces holding space, feeling cramped
Maybe I\u2019m not who I thought I was
Or can be who I said I would
My conjured tongue strong blood
Immaterial to material damn cuz
Make it so, in the image of my most perfect projection
Life is anything but static, supreme mathematics
Repeating numbers, cycles patterns
Summers, winters
Starting later, ending faster
Babel question, chaos answered
Wave reflected all directionEmbed
