Pommelhorse Lyrics
It started as a lesson of achieving dreams and reaching fantastical heights
Ended with us watching\u2005the\u2005Challenger rocket smoldering\u2005on the black and white
Flame licked\u2005flame, like lovers do
Feelings bum rush logic, tend to tumble through, pardon who
Open sky, click the box, they cut the lights in the room
In the summer before 9/11, I slept with my boots on where I could
This ain't no boo-hoo retelling, I was still killing my square, I was good
I got where I needed to be a few days before we breathed different
Hammering horseshoes, a pale horse is fitting
Clean entrance, blood stamped, services rendered, paid in full
Booming succession, I'm on the roof across the river
Every nerve at attention, no reception, soul in suspension
I'm grounded but sinked into African burial ground from here to Seneca village
You can't dig a hole fast enough, deep enough, wide as fuck
Built for comfort, not for speed
Peak optimization of Earth, digest the meat
Scream therapy
Coaxing melodies from the noise
You know, I never lost my song


When the moon and the planet and the stars collapse
Collapse, collapse, collapse, collapse
When the planet and the stars and the moon collapse
Collapse, collapse, collapse, collapse
When the stars and the moon and the planet collapse
Collapse, collapse, collapse, collapse
When the moon and the planet and the stars collapse
Collapse, collapse, collapse, collapse
You might also like
With that mortgage, tornado insurance
That house will be my old lady's coffin
Ill winds, more often snatch negroes off porches
Took the curtain down, Oz
Corporation to corporation remorseless
Bureaucrats cautious, calling corporate, calling corporate
Wind rattle your shingle, gavel bang
Now you human chattel, the king thought to mingle with the rabble
Fell back leaking
The people, with claws reaching, eyes like sequins
While candles glow, play my mother's piano in a bando
Dueling banjoes, get money (get money)
But these pennies feel like they can cover manholes
Shoot hick cops, Rambo, Mujaheddin still on
A simpler time, busting Mexican brick into dime
Feeling like Pennywise, what a time to be alive
Tackle over chicken thighs, Church's fried
Boarded up, we still inside, goat's hide
While you fuck jealous
Might trip you on the stairs to the cellar
Show you forever, together, numb, great
Sichuan pepper sprayed awake
The leper'll tell you straight
Family and friends'll lie to your face
Lie to the last day
Lie after that while you molder in the grave

When the moon and the planet and the stars collapse
Collapse, collapse, collapse, collapse
When the planet and the stars and the moon collapse
Collapse, collapse, collapse, collapse
When the stars and the moon and the planet collapse
Collapse, collapse, collapse, collapse
When the moon and the planet and the stars collapse
Collapse, collapse, collapse, collapse


My brother wanted to build a zoo, he wanted to build a utopia. Because when he looked around him, all he seen was destruction in our neighborhood, you know what I'm saying?
How much, how much did it cost to feed a tiger, like for a week?
Shit, man, yo, that cost families, man, you know what I'm saying? Sometimes you know, you got money coming in, sometimes you don't got money coming in, so the grind is crazy, you understand what I'm saying? Sometimes I had to go in the supermarket and take chicken
So if it got hungry, did you get scared?
If that shit got hungry, then I had to go take chickenEmbed
