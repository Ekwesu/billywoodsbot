Stonefruit Lyrics
I don't wanna lose control but
I can't cramp my space to grow
Comforts dull but gets us through
I got so much left to undo
I don't wanna lose control but
I can't cramp my space to grow
Comforts dull but gets us through
I got so much left to undo


Chaos dissolves, distills what's true
I have so much more left to do
It never ends, like light I bend
I call four winds, sight beyond men
I walk through doors, my name's on no list
Change is not for sure a slow shift
Glacial tides, the tides are rising
Got too high? Dive in, I lied, when?
I really came in on a cyclone
Disciple, scribed the scroll with my eyes closed
Knives thrown, Black Congo
Blowin' smoke, slappin' congas, ther\u0435 I go, there I go
Flexibility, r\u0435ciprocity (I go)
What I need but you're not all I need, that's impossible, ayy
You might also like
Don't wanna lose control but
I can't cramp my space to grow
Comforts dull but gets us through
I got so much left to undo, I
I don't wanna lose control, but
I can't cramp my space to grow (Ayy)
Comforts dull but gets us through
I got so much left to undo, I


Said \Okay\ to save face, but she never forgave
It's only so many ways you can say grace
In truth, she rather cry at your grave
All black regalia, we back not speakin'
Back behind bougainvillea, you can't peek in
Marginalia, busy with symbols and equations
The story too simple to calculate it, payment post-dated
The pavement gave way to a thicket of thorns
Where the body lay naked as the day I was born
She rocked my teeth in a necklace, gulped blood from a horn
Ruby Woo, facin' Mecca, hair disheveled and torn
She left what was left in a ditch, she dream of the sex
She finished on top and howled in the crook of my neck
She dragged the bones home and built a bed
She drank Ros\u00e9 out the skull but held it gentle as my living head

I don't wanna lose control but
I can't cramp my space to grow
Comforts dull but gets us through
I got so much left to undo
I don't wanna lose control but
I can't cramp my space to grow6Embed
