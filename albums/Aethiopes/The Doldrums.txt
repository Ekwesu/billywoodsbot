The Doldrums Lyrics
Cold fryer full of old grease
You don't work, you don't eat
The wind didn't blow for a week
Birds fly east searchin' for green
Open beaks in the nest, money machines
Flutterin', flags, covetous hags
It's not really movin' if it's not movin' fast
Mouth full of glass
Mouth full of glass
Water like a mirror, cut the gas with precision scissors
Bent to the task as if gravedigger
When it was slow cut each other's hair with clippers
Bullets cuttin' through dead air lookin' for victims
Vickers, VSM stamped on the ammunition
That's unusual though
Usually you sit there, the sun come and go
The moon float, horses thrown overboard kick fast, then slow
It don't really matt\u0435r which
Thick mist, piff smoke, draw straws from clenched fists
Sinkin' ship, human souls in th\u0435 hull
He got the whole world in his hands, ice cold
Open them palms up, turned black as a ghost


Nothin' ever happens 'til it do
Waterproof boots, almost new
Moms shook her head, \you shouldn't wear a dead man's shoe\
Nothin' ever happens 'til it does
Muchos problemas if you don't have it for the plug (trust me)
You might also like
Time's up
Nobody ever really did it for the love
We exchange time for drugs
Time piled up, but it was never enough
Time flies when you call a nigga bluff
Time ran down on us like the first of the month, and dumped
Caught him lackin', wakin' up on a park bench a bum


Nothin' ever happens 'til it do
Waterproof boots, like new
Moms shook her head, \shouldn't wear a dead man's shoes\
Nothin' ever happens 'til it does
Muchos problemas if you don't have it for the plug


In tight spaces I learned not to speak
Submarine skirtin' mountain peaks
Fernando Po's Black Beach
Yemeni traders off the coast of Mozambique
Packed bodegas, akh in the weeds
Gold shimmerin' in the reef
African water in the lengths of the piece
Tha Carter III pour out a double parked Jeep
The rain starts the minute I leave
At the corner the water waist deep

Nothin' ever happens 'til it do
Waterproof boots, waterproof boots
Nothin' ever happens 'til it does
Muchas problemas if you don't have it for the plug1Embed
