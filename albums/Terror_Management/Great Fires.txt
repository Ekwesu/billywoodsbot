Great Fires Lyrics
It's a, fire truck on Christmas morning, fresh out the wrapping paper


Catch-22, Catch-22
When I laugh\u2005miss\u2005you worse
Goin' through\u2005loud like Mexican dirt
Somethin' off, it's\u2005like it don't work
Sleep a steep fall, wake up like a stray dog
You wonder where she found the strength not to call
You're proud of her, you know what it costs
But, you would do anything at all, you would do anything at all

It was fine 'til everybody left
But it was terrible before they did, like holdin' your breath
Fun at first
4:30AM, I'm in the kitchen with the stove turnt
I'm in my bag with the blunt burnt
Life laid across the table like crossword puzzle
The heart struggle, muscle memory made everything a hustle
White knuckle, black chuckle
Don't talk about love, It's a hell of a drug
I remember how she waited for me to say it
Breath bated, we was on the phone
I wish I could have waited inside that moment forever
Like a beat loop
