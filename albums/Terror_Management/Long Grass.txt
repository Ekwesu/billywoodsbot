Long Grass Lyrics
Part of yo attack kombat don set
What a bad one
Last of the realest, we know\u2005the\u2005facts
Give 'em a\u2005minute, been a year since he\u2005had one
Tag teaming the demons, we walk freely, free
Reachin' over the city
Tryna protect my investments, dusty
Loops since the last twenty two segments
Momma need rent, some love and a necklace
Niggas need the most when the less present
Trust me, I'ma get that
I need the land for my kin, I need all that
I'm sleep awake in my skin, cozy eye might fall back, call back
My spirits know me closely, they contacts
You ain't lookin', use your contacts
Legs up, I'm runnin', no contracts
These laps ain't for the weak or the rats, facts
Facts
Trust me my nigga


Dust, dust, dust
Dusty boots, kickin' up envy
People caught up in muffled mentals
Pantalones in need of bootstraps
The traps filled to cusp, overflowin' cups
Dusty boots, kickin' up envy
People caught up in muffled mentals
Pantalones in need of bootstraps
The traps filled to cusp, overflowin' cups

A rising tide lift all boats, oh, you don't got a boat?
Niggas betta learn to swim to quote Save Yourself they won't throw a rope
Water at your chest, lies in your throat
You gon' see when it at your neck though
.38, nothin' special
Blood speckle, my visage
Art deco, my lineage
Echo rock paintings geckos, lizards sun bathin'
The rock's blazin, her maidenhead taken
In the tall grass, somethin' waitin'
Glaciers breakin', clean as that white
Or white rooms where you break, make a statement
When the piper come, you people best pay him
For God's sake, you best pray to him
You best say the hymn, you not worried 'bout swimmin', you know it won't be water again


I'm gettin' in trouble now
SomedayEmbed
