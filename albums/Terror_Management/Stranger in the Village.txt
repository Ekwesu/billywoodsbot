Stranger in the Village Lyrics
Billy woods European Vacation, take 7
8, 9


Came through atop a half-dead mule
Apostate marabout
Pale urchins put\u2005the\u2005swoosh on his\u2005pointy shoe
A slew of rare pelts,\u2005helm a skull of caribou
Blood on the ice shelf, snares is simple loops
Trinkets that bitches think is cute
Dirty pictures that he keep outta view
Minor riches looted from who know who
Piano wire on a spool, thread for the loom
Dog eared first edition of Barracoon
Jah Goo mix grabba that's the jet fuel
Ivory mouth, skin so black it's blue
Ain't never been south, never seen the dunes
Regale 'em with tales of Khartoum
Eyes big nuff to drown
Gather round, gather round
