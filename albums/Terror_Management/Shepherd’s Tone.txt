Shepherd\u2019s Tone Lyrics
If you prove it, I'll do it
I'll do anything
If you prove it


The sky empty/trees like\u2005widows\u2005huddled
The boar muzzle\u2005nuzzle, iridescent black truffle
Black snow in\u2005the forest
Quiet like Babi Yar with the corpses
Put the devil in the cage, he made him a fortress
Why the long faces? (Drink!)
We was fortunate to make a fortune off it
Heavy metal, the kids play cautious
Heavy water, the drip just nauseous
Silent spring/strange wind
A dead spider in the middle of it's web
Sun spun gold in its threads
The sun set red in The West
Bled till it's nothin' left
The ground still thirsty
On this Earth it's no mercy
Rot where you fall like sick cattle
The ground grab you


And like your prey
These savory things
Ignite your need to quip
If I'd like to stay
Go on, just stay
But I'm not in my right way
No symbol, no innocent angle, sits
Inside my lingo, I am twist of if
And well, if you do forsake me
I'll not be forsworn
