That Was Then Lyrics
We used to make a killing
We used to be tight
Used to keep it in a\u2005drop\u2005ceiling
Round here used\u2005to be wild at night
Used to\u2005live in that building
I used to love your wife
Used to lie naked looking at the ceiling
We used to get stupid high
Used to hear them things peelin' off erry mahfucking night


That was then, this is now
That was then, this is now


A face for the crowd at the book signing
A rueful smile
We used to put the dro in vials
No doubt, that was then, this is now
I read it when it came out
I read it when it came out
How the devil always find my house?
Flashlight in the mouth
Gift horses get cavity checks
Barricade the door before bed
Dreads taped to papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head
Fred Hampton would be here today
Say it with a straight face (a straight face)
Laugh when he says this Apartheid the other way
(Now you catching on!)
Hung up your phone
Spun up a cone
You might also like
That was then, this is now, homes
That was then, now we grown
That was then, but it's been now all along
That was then, this is now
(Now all along)
That was then, this is nowEmbed
