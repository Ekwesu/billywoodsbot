 toothy Lyrics
\Dessert? Are you having dinner Mr. Wolf?\
\Uh, not yet, not yet, my dear. Ho ho ho ho ho.\


Halloween on Christmas
Make sure the mask fit
Eyes glitterin' through the eyeholes, exchange gifts
Station chief in Cairo, add a name to the list
That's '86
The Benz armor plated, look how it sit
Mugabe never hesitated, Samora did
That's why Samora dead and Lee Perry alive
Cancer ate Marley leg, ol' Bob won't die
All told, he told no lies
Count to ten when close both eyes
Orphan said, \More, please.\
Persephone came home to Orpheus with sore knees, flushed cheeks
I get why you don't wanna believe, that water get deep
Obama Kush when he speak, so articulate
Leaf stuck in his buck teeth
Stuck, in the bucket seats
Tow truck, pull me through Manhattan
Waved like a king
Woe to whoever not clappin'
Rats scatter in a predictable pattern
The pimp nails like talons
Gratuity include in the final balance
Gallons and gallons out that Niger Delta
But when his name came up e'rybody fell silent
You might also like
Oh Granny, what big eyes you got
All the better to watch for the cops
Oh Granny, what big ears those is
All the better to hear the pigs
Oh Granny, those are some sharp teef
All the better when it's time to eat


Still in my seat when the movie end
When the credits roll, big toothy grin
Big ol' bag of candy I snuck in
Might as well run it again
Weed this strong, your limbic system not a friend, it's not a friend
E'ry knee bends when the engineer cue his stems
Wax nostalgic 'bout future events
Unlawful possession of financial instruments
Frowny Face
Made haste to vacate the place
The ride smelled like wedding cake
Steeplechase
She pressed gas, I pumped the brakes
Sheepish face
How bad you wanna know, like a box of unmarked VHS tapes (How bad?)
In your Dad's storage space nobody knew about
'Til he passed, they called, the payment was late
The rust flaked off when you raised the gate
\Toodle-oo.\
\Goodbye Mr. Wolf.\
\Toodle-oo.\
When you raised the grate

\The wolf stood looking after Red Riding Hood and when she was out of sight, he grinned
A wide grin
Showing all of his long glistening teeth.\Embed
