 red dust Lyrics
It's not the heat, it's the dust
It's not the money, it's the rush
It's not the weed, that's a crutch
It's not greed, that's not enough
It's not the heat, it's the dust
It's not the drugs, it's the cut
It's not the act, it's the touch
It's how she arch her back when she-


Knock the plane out the sky
Spark the genocide
Let's see who gives who a place to hide
You might be surprised (You might not)
Either way, it'd be wise to retrieve that black box
If you live, sometimes it's best just to circle the block
I was in the ceilin' when they swept the buildin'
I kept my head down when the cops came for the children
I rode the train er'y day past that fuckin' prison
I broke bread with killas and rapists
I got money with niggas you should not leave with a child for two fuckin' seconds
They don't tell you that in they raps
Don't tell me that's the past
I live in the past jack
It ain't even that different
Niggas rhyme fast about bitches
Niggas supposedly abstract
White boys take what they want and just flip it, flip it
Shrug before he licked the revolver, shoulda listened
Now these are shenanigans, you have all witnessed the system
Crocodile slid it in, almost graceful how he swim
I'm a savage, volcano rim, just toss him in
You might also like
It's not the heat, it's the dust
It's not the money, it's the rush
It's not the weed, that's a crutch
It's not greed, that's not enough (It's not enough)
It's not the heat, it's the dust (It's not enough, man, that's the problem)


You on the list
Planet ain't big enough, we can't coexist
Say my prayers e'ry night you'll be in the mix
I can't wait, dream about it like sex
Etch you off the writ
Help you remember what you tryna forget
I want us to be alone in your home
I wanna suck the marrow out ya bones
I wanna show you what I learned from the worst people I ever known
I wanna follow you like the Jakes
I wanna swallow you, show you the hate inside, it's a lake
So cold, so deep
I see you, you never saw me
Transferred to the sea
So close, I can see a nick from shavin'
Your neck so exposed
Your throat would open like a hose
Eyes wide open, I would watch you go
Seeing you in hell, all I think about when they say woods
That's all she wrote
I know the list long
I put you at the fuckin' top though3Embed
