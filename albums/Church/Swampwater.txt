Swampwater Lyrics
Here recently I was up in Colorado
(If there is a deep in here calling)
And I\u2005was\u2005standing upon a\u2005mountain
(There has to be a deep\u2005to respond to that call)


Tell your boy I only want the crippy with the red hairs
Same one from when Giuliani was mayor
The science is clear
Words chosen more carefully when the threat of violence in the air
Don't wait till it's too late, come round to the fact you's a square (Me too)
Just tryna eat, I don't wanna see how the beef prepared
In their p\u0435ns, the sheep is scared
Penit\u0435ntiary blues if the opps run your tier
One tear
Forty hours a week plus the commute, it's really no time for fear
Maybe here and there
Over your grave a goose change gears
The science is weird
Mayans never counted to here
Dying sun glare through thin atmosphere
Windshield smeared, A/C blasting old air
Standstill traffic, human landfills dot the landscape, ravaged
Trousers on the ape, but he still savage
Wowzers on the taste, I went right back, copped the whole package
Your mans not great, but I do chuckle at the ad-libs
Life is short, who am I to judge how you terror manage?
No three line on the court and my kicks is canvas
To put it on Al's speakers' the only reason I flew to Los Angeles
Chengdu Taste, crosstown, midday, I defy the establishment
