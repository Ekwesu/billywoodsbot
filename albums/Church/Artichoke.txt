Artichoke Lyrics
It's certain things you can only learn from a fistfight
I used to use a toothbrush to keep my kicks white
It mattered that much
In hindsight, it seemed like someone else's life
Flush my system with sativas
Knock off the rust and fuck standing up
White phosphorus burning through the night
Skeleton crew on a slaver, hug the equator tight
Drone fly like metal kite
Hellfire out the sky, open your book to Revelations
Anyone hatin', this your chance to get right
Ceremony in the church basement
In the dark, waitin' for the bride


Move like The Black Codes
Folded paper in my coat
Came home to coal-fired stove, little fish fulla bones
Chokin', the weeds overgrown, the weeds overgrown
The weeds overgrown, the weeds overgrown
Move like The Black Codes
Folded paper in my coat
Came home to coal-fired stove, little fish fulla bones
Chokin', the weeds overgrown, the weeds overgrown
The weeds overgrown

Young boy asked if it's pressure, I bent the knee as a gesture
Every move measured
Weighing up while she laying there pregnant
Lotta rappers worry about gender bending
I just peep who ask the question

I won't even hold you
Two track it with the superdry vocal
Cyborg, they had to cut him out the car, totalled
At the service, looking sad, but really mad over how much dough he still owed you
(I want my money, funeral or no funeral, I want my money)
A piece of the action is all I'm askin'
Everything broke down into fractions
The fire long dead, this just smoke and ashes
Hope is an assassin, fear fill up the casket
One day I woke up, everything was made of plastic
\She loves me not\ is where we landed
When the music stops, folks start looking for answers
Embarrassed child go looking for handguns
Extended clip on the stick
Ear protection for the tantrum


Move like The Black Codes
Folded papers in my coat
Came home to coal-fired stove, little fish fulla bones
Chokin', the weeds overgrown, the weeds overgrown
The weeds overgrown, the weeds overgrown
Move like The Black Codes
Folded paper in my coat
Came home to coal-fired stove, little fish fulla bones
Chokin', the weeds overgrown, the weeds overgrown
The weeds overgrown, the weeds overgrown

Let Him be first of all. Then, the hunger, deep. As David said, \When the deep calleth to the deep, at the noise of thy waterspouts.\
Now, the deep calling to the deep. For instance thisEmbed
