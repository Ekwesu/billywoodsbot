Rock Cried Lyrics
I hold space that can't be curved
Snake coil, ribcage of dark goddess
Hallow be thy name in the belly of existance
Mystic nights of square fables, snake and man
Lamb and sacrifice, mothers of darkness
A priest without his head council of 33 inside the dome of heaven
Under the tongue a reverend
Oh lord, oh God, don't come down, stay high
The rock cried, I can't hide you
They gon' find you
They gon' lynch you and call it suicide
Where you gonna run to?
The rock cried, the rock cried


I had experiences on the stage that I didn\u2019t think were possible and then a strange thing happened. On the stage, I was complete and perfect. Lacking no essential characteristics, nothing. The curtain came down and, who am I?, who am I?


Landfill smolderin'
Hydroxychloroquine unpacked and boxed up again
With no point of origin
Everything overboard, if they board us
His own land feel foreign to him
And for the record, fuck preservation
Rather swing in the wind
Purple face, tongue black, hangin' out, warnin' my kin
For my kind, I go out on a limb
Young kings
Short range, blood sing in the veins
Kids play wargames, untaught
Dead braves dance around the burnin' fort
Buyers remorse for everything that we bought
But he'll still pry the pennies off the eyes of a corpse
