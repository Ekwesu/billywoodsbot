Mom\u2019s Gold Lyrics
I get up to the front of the line, they push me back in the rear
And from the evil, mean, look that they had on they face
I said, 'Damn, what am I doin' here?'
I said, 'Please, Martin Luther King, I don't wanna vote, whoa,'
I said, \Please, Reverend King, please don't make me vote, whoa'
I had a dream last night, I asked for my equal rights
Somebody said, 'Mom, you're next,' and there I stood with a rope around my neck
