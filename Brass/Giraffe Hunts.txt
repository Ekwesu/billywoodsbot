Giraffe Hunts Lyrics
It's beautiful
The sun a bruised orange, clouds sparse, sky mauve
The light soft as though filtered through gauze, pause
Rollin' barrel bombs to where the helicopter doors was tooken off
The rotors was too loud to talk


Meet black dirty Diana, prancer, stranded
23rd necromancer, chancellor 
Wraths of grape
Purple fields, purple haze
Devil's prolly smoked his ransom
Candy flip, cameo, tongue lash
Rattlesnake fast rap, I'm stuck
Foaming lip, frosty, yesterday's spit shine
Even when we're loot\u0435d
Loud bombs, I think I'm gon' be shootin'
The big up rose up lik\u0435 the Baltimore Putin
Talkin' bout, ain't a damn thing movin'


The zoo had a decapitated giraffe
A dedicated staff of volunteers, the acid was bad
The gift shop was packed
Congolese hands chopped and dropped in your gift bag
Seepin' blood turned the gift wrap black
Marrow weepin' out the cracks, sweet king crab
Darwin screamin' out his sleep, in the dream it was a laugh though
Traffic stop, I reach for my slave pass slow
Quill and ink, brittle parchment
Waved through by the sergeant
You might also like
Slipped behind the  town
Saw men draw meridians through life lines
Why we tip-toe 'round these land mines and fault lines
Feel the earth movin', flat earth see-saw
Me and woods in the rickshaw being pulled by horses
I'm hearin' voices
The sky was red, and oyster shells are for 
Is this so?, it seems distorted
Lines recorded
Ways of life, the sergeant yelled, come over
His arms king cobras, I fainted on sight


On the train home, a Maasai warrior asked me for change
I said no
They were shootin' bison out the same train
Crack lightning, gunsmoke
Not a word, just brass pingin' on the floor
Express to 42nd
Deafened by the retort of the weapons
We wound through ancient burial grounds
For women who went missin'
Guns sound like supercars shiftin'
Train car black as a scorched piston
Fly agaric spores driftin'
Sword slick with blood, the lord giveth

What redeems it is the idea only
An idea at the back of it, not a sentimental pretense
But an idea and an unselfish belief in the idea
Something you can set up and bow down before and offer a sacrifice to1Embed
