Chimney Lyrics




What, what?
Yo, so many stories told by men who's hearts ran cold
He was sold the myth, said he ain't have no home
He came outta dirt, fell a thousand stories
Yeah, he fell from Earth
On the map, upside down, fell right in a curse
In an embrace with death, he fell in a hearse
You can't make this up, well I guess you can
Arms expand, the real imagined by the 'maginary man


They said let him go, so I let him float
Might catch you where the river bend though
You n\u0435ver know (You never know)
You n\u0435ver know (You never know)
You never know, human skin lined the coat (You never know)
Half penny to ride the boat
An honest days wages, but here you are
Old and broke, tippy toe (Tippy toes)
But you the one what strung the rope
We sacked Rome in ski-masks, stripped the pope
Give it up fast old man, muzzle flash, he gave up the ghost
Nowadays he never miss salat, he be doin' the most
He be doin' the most
You might also like
Chimney full of sinners, soot and cinders
Gold teeth in the black dust, the chimney cook all winter
Chimney full of sinners, soot and cinders
Gold teeth in the black dust, the chimney cook all winter
Chimney full of sinners, soot and cinders
Wedding rings in the black dust, the chimney cook all winter






Smoke with me, or not
Smoke with me the whole fifty-piece, flow so sticky it look easy
Ken Griffey swing so pretty it's like a nigga cheatin'
The form is mid-season (Always brother, always)

You used to tear the page careful and tape it to the wall
This before you fell off
Before niggas put you on
This before you started smokin' cigarettes and sellin' raw
Bo don't know nothin' about a eight ball
This before, Topps rookie laminated in the top drawer
This when you thought a nigga really could win it all
Tear the page careful and tape it to the wallEmbed
