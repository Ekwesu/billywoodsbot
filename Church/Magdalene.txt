Magdalene Lyrics
Yeah
She's like, \How you- how you like it?\
I said, \I like it like butter\


Suck my dick and tell me I'm beautiful
How I wake up in her jaws been the usual
What's sacred, what's suitable
What's profane, Magdalene
Wash me with her hair from sole to cuticle
Send him through the roof
Straight up to the moon again
Moody control, getting at the root
Seed bearing fruit
Breaking skin, I got the juice now
Can't waste a minute, I birthed a few styles
Who they hot-pursuing?
I heard I was in Houston
Won't catch 'em running like that brother from Carson
Black market arms push up the margin
Buffing chinks in the armor
Weighing Carbon's karma
Don't tell me who you are, I'm asking who you aren't
All city, tell me where you want it
I'll be there in the morning
Deserving of the rarest garments
Riding 'round buzzed
Peel toward darkness
Scrape your face to this
Bought three Ziplocs couldn't wait to spark it
Finger lime in the spice shop, spinning
Spilling cheap red on white socks
Planetary rhythm
Odd pocket on the houndstooth
Sliding through
Sometime the song find you
Uh
You might also like
Don't ask me how I get it, trust I get it, ha
Don't ask me how I get it, bet I get it (Don't ask me how I-)
Ay,  Don't ask me how I get it, trust I get it (Trust I- uh)
Don't ask me how I get it, that I get it, ha (That I-)


She said, \Come get me and I'm yours,\ then the line went dead
Put bread on her phone, she said the same in a text
Bro said, \She don't wanna be saved, get it through your fuckin' head\ (Get it through your fuckin' head)
Mulled it over, then slept all day so I could drive the next
Still dark when I left
Streets empty, window cracked wishin' I still smoked cigarettes
Check engine light lit
Brights plow the night
Split-lip selfie, said he'd never do it again
He done it twice
She wish she never left me, wish she could make it right
She cried, I cried
Been waiting my whole life, I'ma hold on tight
Won't make the same mistakes
Broken white lines, blowin' through states
Ridin' clean, so I don't give a fuck 'bout Jake
Eighteen months clean, barely touched the brakes
When I kiss her in dreams I can taste the acetate
Couldn't get hard, watched her masturbate
Blood trickle out one nostril
Ball was a masquerade
Jerked awake
Rest area in the Carolinas, judging by the plates
Ate Chick-fil-a
Gas station sink, wash my face
Text again, nothing since yesterday
Funny feeling, a familiar weight
Returned the key, bought a pack, grimaced at the taste
Couldn't finish, wheels spinnin'
Car full of ghosts, HOV lane
Coast right off the interstate
Straight to voicemail
It's a familiar rage
Far from home but it's a familiar place
GPS my fate
Human remains when you dredge those lakes
The road narrows, lush underbrush pressing
The vehicle barrels
Doubt and questions rattle like wedding cans on the getaway car1Embed
