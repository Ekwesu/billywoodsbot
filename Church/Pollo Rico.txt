Pollo Rico Lyrics
Almighty God, who created heavens and earth, I ask now that every demon power in this building will be broke. Lord, weak, but we're not defeated!


This thing was broke from the jump
No point going back and forth over who did what
My character arc: Rolling Loud to Shakespeare in the Park
You get stabbed, stagger off in the dark
I'm waiting in the wings, understudied every part
I lied 'cause I loved her, I never crossed my heart
Showed my face, but left right when it started to start
A man apart, drink alone, packed bar
A stack'll turn a stan to your man at arms
A little gas, crash dummies flying out the cars


Hospital vending machine, D2 is the Cheetos
New Years Eve, I snuck in the Clicquot
Pollo Rico, yuca fries
Louis XIV in a vape, you hit it twice (The Finest)
I hope it's nothing but hoes in paradise
Hospital vending machine, D2 is the Cheetos
New Years Eve, I snuck in the Clicquot
Pollo Rico, yuca fries
Louis XIV in a vape, you hit it twice (The Finest)
I hope it's nothing but hoes in paradise
You might also like
When the revolution was over, they gave 'em half what they promised
Let's be honest
And the ones who bust they guns went home to tin cups of tea
That same plate of porridge (Let's be honest)
Wake up thinking 'bout the ones they left in the forest
It's no church in the wild
My uncle told me they can't bury that many bodies
They burned 'em in piles
It was dark, I could see his teeth, it wasn't a smile
Fire in the hearth, fire in tipped bottle
Long slip, sharp hiss, eyes sunk in they hollows
My heart used to sing, crossing the old Goethals
Money for the plug, Megabus apostles looking for the love
You don't gotta open it up, I got wide nostrils
Woolly hair, feet made of brass
Ghost over Teddy Pendergrass if I see the devil moving fast
Send lookin'-ass niggas through the looking glass


Hospital vending machine, D2 is the Cheetos
New Years Eve, I snuck in the Clicquot
Pollo Rico, yuca fries
Louis XIV in a vape, you hit it twice (The Finest)
I hope it's nothing but love in paradise
Hospital vending machine, D2 is the Cheetos
New Years Eve, I snuck in the Clicquot
Pollo Rico, yuca fries
Louis XIV in a vape, you hit it twice (The Finest)
I hope it's nothing but love in paradise6Embed
