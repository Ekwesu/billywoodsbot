Paraquat Lyrics


Spot on 116 must've had the cops in they pocket
Hydro jars, fifty a pop, line out the door
This back when we had the nerve to call brickweed chocolate
Stacy said her sister's boyfriend had the new hot shit
Gave me the plug like a stock tip
I found religion, I'm a prophet
Loved that girl, but knew we wouldn't work like Harden on the Rockets
Clouds cleared, I'm looking at the city like jihadis in a cockpit
Prices so fucking high, I had to do 'em dirty just to make a profit
Splits like Spotify numbers
A whole lotta green, just me and the punter
Down for the team, saying all the right things
But feeling like Harden on the Thunder


We was raised on paraquat, scraped and fought
By the grace of God, everybody else got caught
We was raised on paraquat, scraped and fought
By the grace of God, everybody else got caught
We was raised on paraquat, scraped and fought
By the grace of God, everybody else got caught
We was raised on paraquat, scraped and fought
By the grace of God

In DC they called me New York, I didn't correct it (why would I?)
Brother started on that Malachi Z
I said I eat pork and besides, I don't respect it (I don't)
You out here smoking Newports
Please man, let me eat my breakfast




We was raised on it, right?
Light drizzle on the tarmac
Whitey hit Hiroshima, then he doubled back
Black rain baptize black skies
I'm always waiting on a thunderclap
Feed 'em rope till it goes slack
Hot potato, when your quick lick turn to a kidnap
It's easy to take, hard to give back (It's hard to give)
Deep in the Tombs on a humble Pentecostal crumble
In a Sweet and Aromatic
My dude came home like Papillon, his spirit never captured
But truth be told, he never had a second chapter
Camo, green and gold, pull me in the sky, it's the Rapture
Anno Domini, it's no before, it's only after


We was raised on paraquat, scraped and fought
By the grace of God, everybody else got caught
We was raised on paraquat, scraped and fought
By the grace of God, everybody else got caught

That was the haze for a long time
Let's get like some wine, like let's not skip the process
1988 till like 2004-2005
Just an uptown thing, on 45th St, they had it by the pounds
It was seven thousand dollars a pound back then before the AIDS
We did thatEmbed
