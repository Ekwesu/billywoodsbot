Cossack Wedding Lyrics


Disaster tourists wandering, Chernobyl's wildlife flourish
She said it herself, \You gotta hold something back\
That's insurance
That sarcophagus crack, the purest radiation flow out my phone jack like a Keurig
A snap of her collarbone, black bra strap, never nothing lurid
For those Cold Wars you need endurance
Dead fish, wild boars swollen with tumors
Snippets of dialogue swimming in her aqueous humor


The alienation zone is 30 kilometers wide
I'm a sucker, I fall for it every time
My betrothed fled to the forest, hid in th\u0435 pines
Still set a place for h\u0435r, unlatched the door so she could come inside
The alienation zone is 30 kilometers wide
I'm a sucker, I fall for it every time
My betrothed fled to the forest, hid in the pines
Still set a place for her, unlatched the door so she could come inside


A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again
Solzhenitsyn, she skipped to the end
The cold creepin' in my bones
Wind whip around my home
She came when I'm sleepin', breasts leakin', pussy unkempt
Around her the light bent
Spliff hitting right, light like a opium den
Couldn't quite see her face, it was like the night moved with her whim
I had the piff with a fragile stems
She had some dour from a \friend\ (Hmm)
Nobody beats the Biz, I mind my business
It's wolves beyond the fences, snares in the snow
Wolves at home in bed, peep the teeth like a dentist
Irredentist Red Army Faction
Around the crib I dug trenches
Mined roads
Interrogated peasants
The mine closed, the shaft open
Who knows where the mind goes
In the morning my pillow smell of pine cones
