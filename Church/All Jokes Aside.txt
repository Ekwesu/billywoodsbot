All Jokes Aside Lyrics
Marciano on a snow day, cold play
Math rock, soda, no cocaine
I'm always surprised by the co-pay, sick!
Once they broke open the safe
A newspaper dated March 15, '88
Few CD-Rs, couple pictures where I ain't cover my face
Megagraphitti on a VHS tape
A guap of Haze, just in case
Mr. Serv-On from back in the day
I been around since long, I got a couple names
Pragmatic as the metric system
But this America, might have to throw it all away in an instant
Over an insult, a turn of phrase
Incense in the foyer, granny with the cane
They wait for h\u0435r to die, but till then, that rent don't rais\u0435
We boiled water to bathe, the place smelled like Raid
The eyes take a moment to adjust so you can see what's inside the cage
From your book I took a page, bell hooks
I'm squatting on stage, hoping I never took more than I gave


All jokes aside, I enjoyed the ride
I miss my guys, took the church and put it in the sky
All jokes aside, I enjoyed the ride
I miss my guys, took the church and put it in the sky
All jokes aside, I enjoyed the ride
I miss my guys, took the church and put it in the sky
All jokes aside
You might also like
Say what you want, but show me the lie
The laws I enforce is maritime
We wavy? Yes or no, no maybes
That type of time
SWAPO safehouse in Windhoek
I'm proof they made it out alive (We survived)
Dutch baby, burnt sugar, sweet between those thighs
Jersey Turnpike, Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so 'til it's goodbye
Waving on the runway walking backwards
Cloudless sky, the sun in back of us
Half of Liberia in the back of the class
I filled a backwood
Unapologetic
You can't win 'em all, but I'm sorry for the hurt I caused
FedEx packages lost, never sign no forms
If she's gone, she's gone (She's gone)
She's gone (She's gone)
Came outside after the locusts swarmed (She's gone)


All jokes aside, I enjoyed the ride
I miss my guys, took the church and put it in the sky
All jokes aside, I enjoyed the ride
I miss my guys, took the church and put it in the sky
All jokes aside, I enjoyed the ride
I miss my guys, took the church and put it in the sky
All jokes asideEmbed
