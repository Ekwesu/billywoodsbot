Frankie Lyrics
Haze shouldn't even exist
I ain't gonna lie, haze almost shouldn't exist, we just left Cali
Yeah, I couldn't wait to come home
I couldn't wait to come home to hit some haze
(I was high as a life, I don't even got high off of that shit)
This nigga buys all haze, man
Man, the weed man come, he want all haze
You not gettin' high like that
(You in slow motion, you think you in fast motion)
(No that's sour)
Bingo!
But you know you in slow motion
You just think you moving quick and you really not
And you still stuck there
You can't get on the elevator, you can't go to court, you can't go to a wedding, you can't go to your kid's school, you can't go to none of that
But this nigga'll blow all haze in here the whole fucking day
(Haze for life)
G\u0435t that shit outta here
That shit smell lik\u0435 the rainforest, it tastes damp
Gotta roll up one turkey link, roll a turkey link hoss
You gon' roll one turkey link and you good
And you still functioning
That right there is giving you the medicine boy
Before evening time
Blow haze when you see me in my shit
That shit don't even taste right though
That shit taste like the 90s
That's what I'm looking for
You might also like
Morningside Heights, for back then the building was nice
Old biddies out front with The Watchtower ask if you know Christ
She buzzed me up
Elevator grind and hiccup, pray it don't get stuck
I had the Cuban cut (Say word)
Whole floor smell like nag champa
Shoes at the door, roommate Rashanta lit a bowl
No blunts allowed, had to burn it raw
Had to burn it raw


Dick Gregory on vinyl
Rugs like 1970's Cairo
Burnt sage, roll j's on Amharic Bible that she found on 113th
Half the stuff in here they found on the street
I helped carry that TV, stupid big
Corner apartment, the sun run riot
French doors, hardwood shinin' to where the sun got tired
Frankie looking like she might just burst into fire
Summer months burnished by the sun
The crooked teeth just made her more flier
Mismatched sockfeet, a distant choir
Floating
Broken jazz float in
Big windows open
It's easy to forget we in the ocean
Italian icees, Marino's left out 'til slightly unfrozen
Tiny window
Waiting for that momentEmbed
